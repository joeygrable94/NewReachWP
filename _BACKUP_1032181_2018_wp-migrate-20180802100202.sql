This may include personal data, such as name, email address, personal account preferences; transactional data, such as purchase information; and technical data, such as information about cookies.</p><p class="privacy-policy-tutorial">You should also note any collection and retention of sensitive personal data, such as data concerning health.</p><p class="privacy-policy-tutorial">In addition to listing what personal data you collect, you need to note why you collect it. These explanations must note either the legal basis for your data collection and retention or the active consent the user has given.</p><p class="privacy-policy-tutorial">Personal data is not just created by a user&#8217;s interactions with your site. Personal data is also generated from technical processes such as contact forms, comments, cookies, analytics, and third party embeds.</p><p class="privacy-policy-tutorial">By default WordPress does not collect any personal data about visitors, and only collects the data shown on the User Profile screen from registered users. However some of your plugins may collect personal data. You should add the relevant information below.</p><h3>Comments</h3><p class="privacy-policy-tutorial">In this subsection you should note what information is captured through comments. We have noted the data which WordPress collects by default.</p><p><strong class="privacy-policy-tutorial">Suggested text: </strong>When visitors leave comments on the site we collect the data shown in the comments form, and also the visitor&#8217;s IP address and browser user agent string to help spam detection.</p><p>An anonymized string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are using it. The Gravatar service privacy policy is available here: https://automattic.com/privacy/. After approval of your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your comment.</p><h3>Media</h3><p class="privacy-policy-tutorial">In this subsection you should note what information may be disclosed by users who can upload media files. All uploaded files are usually publicly accessible.</p><p><strong class="privacy-policy-tutorial">Suggested text: </strong>If you upload images to the website, you should avoid uploading images with embedded location data (EXIF GPS) included. Visitors to the website can download and extract any location data from images on the website.</p><h3>Contact forms</h3><p class="privacy-policy-tutorial">By default, WordPress does not include a contact form. If you use a contact form plugin, use this subsection to note what personal data is captured when someone submits a contact form, and how long you keep it. For example, you may note that you keep contact form submissions for a certain period for customer service purposes, but you do not use the information submitted through them for marketing purposes.</p><h3>Cookies</h3><p class="privacy-policy-tutorial">In this subsection you should list the cookies your web site uses, including those set by your plugins, social media, and analytics. We have provided the cookies which WordPress installs by default.</p><p><strong class="privacy-policy-tutorial">Suggested text: </strong>If you leave a comment on our site you may opt-in to saving your name, email address and website in cookies. These are for your convenience so that you do not have to fill in your details again when you leave another comment. These cookies will last for one year.</p><p>If you have an account and you log in to this site, we will set a temporary cookie to determine if your browser accepts cookies. This cookie contains no personal data and is discarded when you close your browser.</p><p>When you log in, we will also set up several cookies to save your login information and your screen display choices. Login cookies last for two days, and screen options cookies last for a year. If you select &quot;Remember Me&quot;, your login will persist for two weeks. If you log out of your account, the login cookies will be removed.</p><p>If you edit or publish an article, an additional cookie will be saved in your browser. This cookie includes no personal data and simply indicates the post ID of the article you just edited. It expires after 1 day.</p><h3>Embedded content from other websites</h3><p><strong class="privacy-policy-tutorial">Suggested text: </strong>Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.</p><p>These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.</p><h3>Analytics</h3><p class="privacy-policy-tutorial">In this subsection you should note what analytics package you use, how users can opt out of analytics tracking, and a link to your analytics provider&#8217;s privacy policy, if any.</p><p class="privacy-policy-tutorial">By default WordPress does not collect any analytics data. However, many web hosting accounts collect some anonymous analytics data. You may also have installed a WordPress plugin that provides analytics services. In that case, add information from that plugin here.</p><h2>Who we share your data with</h2><p class="privacy-policy-tutorial">In this section you should name and list all third party providers with whom you share site data, including partners, cloud-based services, payment processors, and third party service providers, and note what data you share with them and why. Link to their own privacy policies if possible.</p><p class="privacy-policy-tutorial">By default WordPress does not share any personal data with anyone.</p><h2>How long we retain your data</h2><p class="privacy-policy-tutorial">In this section you should explain how long you retain personal data collected or processed by the web site. While it is your responsibility to come up with the schedule of how long you keep each dataset for and why you keep it, that information does need to be listed here. For example, you may want to say that you keep contact form entries for six months, analytics records for a year, and customer purchase records for ten years.</p><p><strong class="privacy-policy-tutorial">Suggested text: </strong>If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.</p><p>For users that register on our website (if any), we also store the personal information they provide in their user profile. All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except they cannot change their username). Website administrators can also see and edit that information.</p><h2>What rights you have over your data</h2><p class="privacy-policy-tutorial">In this section you should explain what rights your users have over their data and how they can invoke those rights.</p><p><strong class="privacy-policy-tutorial">Suggested text: </strong>If you have an account on this site, or have left comments, you can request to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also request that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes.</p><h2>Where we send your data</h2><p class="privacy-policy-tutorial">In this section you should list all transfers of your site data outside the European Union and describe the means by which that data is safeguarded to European data protection standards. This could include your web hosting, cloud storage, or other third party services.</p><p class="privacy-policy-tutorial">European data protection law requires data about European residents which is transferred outside the European Union to be safeguarded to the same standards as if the data was in Europe. So in addition to listing where data goes, you should describe how you ensure that these standards are met either by yourself or by your third party providers, whether that is through an agreement such as Privacy Shield, model clauses in your contracts, or binding corporate rules.</p><p><strong class="privacy-policy-tutorial">Suggested text: </strong>Visitor comments may be checked through an automated spam detection service.</p><h2>Your contact information</h2><p class="privacy-policy-tutorial">In this section you should provide a contact method for privacy-specific concerns. If you are required to have a Data Protection Officer, list their name and full contact details here as well.</p><h2>Additional information</h2><p class="privacy-policy-tutorial">If you use your site for commercial purposes and you engage in more complex collection or processing of personal data, you should note the following information in your privacy policy in addition to the information we have already discussed.</p><h3>How we protect your data</h3><p class="privacy-policy-tutorial">In this section you should explain what measures you have taken to protect your users&#8217; data. This could include technical measures such as encryption; security measures such as two factor authentication; and measures such as staff training in data protection. If you have carried out a Privacy Impact Assessment, you can mention it here too.</p><h3>What data breach procedures we have in place</h3><p class="privacy-policy-tutorial">In this section you should explain what procedures you have in place to deal with data breaches, either potential or real, such as internal reporting systems, contact mechanisms, or bug bounties.</p><h3>What third parties we receive data from</h3><p class="privacy-policy-tutorial">If your web site receives data about users from third parties, including advertisers, this information must be included within the section of your privacy policy dealing with third party data.</p><h3>What automated decision making and/or profiling we do with user data</h3><p class="privacy-policy-tutorial">If your web site provides a service which includes automated decision making - for example, allowing customers to apply for credit, or aggregating their data into an advertising profile - you must note that this is taking place, and include information about how that information is used, what decisions are made with that aggregated data, and what rights users have over decisions made without human intervention.</p><h3>Industry regulatory disclosure requirements</h3><p class="privacy-policy-tutorial">If you are a member of a regulated industry, or if you are subject to additional privacy laws, you may be required to disclose that information here.</p></div>";s:5:"added";i:1531161295;}'),

I excel at composing and formulating information into clear visuals that demonstrate mature application of design theory and practice. With a diverse background in digital and print design, I work with local businesses to develop impact driven collateral including marketing tools, brand identity, templates, website design, presentations and visual strategies.\r\n\r\nMy experience working with a startup, an architecture studio, designing for Seattle businesses, and serving on a 501(c)(3) board as the Design and Marketing Chair, allowed me the opportunity to gain in depth knowledge about the professional and creative sides of design.\r\n<h3>People tell me I am good at</h3>\r\n<h4>Asking Questions</h4>\r\nMy process is driven by curiosity. I address challenges creatively by asking questions first. Afterwards, I thoroughly research target markets, audience demographics, typography and design patterns. At the same time, hand sketching and photographic moodboards compliment my research. This part of my process inspires further conceptual development and helps me understand the variables involved — to properly execute a visual strategy that achieves the project goals.\r\n<h4>Iteration &amp; Variation</h4>\r\nI use an iterative design process to explore many design concepts. Team critiques are an important component to iteration. It opens up dialogue between the design concept and its stakeholders. Brainstorming is another tactic I utilize in my workflow to help teams visualize and orient towards a design concept. These conversations inform my process and serve further conceptual development.\r\n<h4>Organization</h4>\r\nWhether it’s my desk space, a quarterly marketing plan, or comprehensive designs, I maintain an organized workspace and accessible workflow. My design process adapts to new project variables easily. This enables me to simplify the process for clients and provide them with resources that support team goals.\r\n\r\n[column_wrap count="2"] [column class="full"]\r\n<h2>I am confident working in</h2>\r\n[/column] [column]\r\n<h3>Industry Knowledge</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Branding design and positioning</li>\r\n 	<li>Visual design for print and digital media</li>\r\n 	<li>Social media marketing</li>\r\n 	<li>Marketing advertisements and campaign design</li>\r\n 	<li>Audio recording and editing</li>\r\n 	<li>Photography and video editing</li>\r\n 	<li>Typography and calligraphy</li>\r\n 	<li>Project management</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n[/column] [column]\r\n<h3>Tools &amp; Languages</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Adobe Creative Suite\r\n(InDesign, Photoshop, Illustrator)</li>\r\n 	<li>Microsoft Office (Word and Excel)</li>\r\n 	<li>Google Analytics</li>\r\n 	<li>Search Engine Optimization</li>\r\n 	<li>HTML5 and CSS3</li>\r\n 	<li>Javascript and jQuery</li>\r\n 	<li>PHP Wordpress Development</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n[/column] [/column_wrap]\r\n<h3>In my free time</h3>\r\nFind me outside rock climbing and camping with my friends—somewhere beautifully surrounded by nature.

In my cozy home studio, I like to improve on my design abilities, bind books, practice calligraphy, and spend time with the lovely <a href="http://samschnabel.com/">Sam Schnabel</a>.

This project is a unique and diverse partnership of many community members and groups that work together to make affordable housing more accessible to individuals, groups and families who are susceptible to the consequences of rapid urban development occurring in the CD.\n<h3>Design Problem &amp; Project Goals</h3>Current information about the leasing process for the Liberty Bank Building is complex, lengthy, and inaccessible to individuals most in need of this very information. Consequently, there has been misinformation spreading about how the application process works for the Liberty Bank Building.\n\nThe project goals are to clarify the eligibility requirements for affordable housing, explain the application process for leasing at the Liberty Bank Building, and affirmatively target audiences affected by rapidly rising rent in the CD. This will be achieved through a leasing packet design that is intuitive and\nsimply explains the affordable housing application process, and will include the following deliverables:\n<h3>Deliverables</h3>(a single packet of the following items)\n<ul>\n 	<li>Overview / timeline document, (similar to the one produced by NY Housing Connect )</li>\n 	<li>FAQs document</li>\n 	<li>General leasing flyer with building features, photos, location map, and income requirements</li>\n 	<li>Income limit sheet (similar to the one produced by NY Housing Connect )</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Successes &amp; Failures</h3>\n<h4>Audience</h4>\n<h5>Primary</h5>Individuals and families living in the CD who qualify for affordable housing and those who are looking for clear information on the leasing process and how to apply for the Liberty Bank Building affordable housing units.\n<h5>Secondary</h5>Community members and small businesses, particularly of pan-african decent, affected by displacement in the CD; or those individuals and community partners at risk of being unable to afford rapid rent increases in the CD’s housing and commercial real estate market.\n<h4>Relationships</h4>\n<h5>Client – LBB Building Partners</h5>The Capitol Hill Housing Association ensures their approach to each community building is both intentional and affective in targeting individuals in need of affordable housing.

(23, 1, '2017-12-07 12:00:36', '2017-12-07 12:00:36', 'Capitol Hill Housing (CHH) is a public corporation organized by the City of Seattle. Their mission is to build vibrant and engaged communities through affordable housing and community development. In total, CHH manages approximately 50 properties, each with eligibility requirements ranging from low-income, elderly, disabled, veteran and other eligibility restricted units.\r\n\r\n[image_block]\r\n<img class="alignnone wp-image-49 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_Resident-Services-poster_11x17.jpg" alt="" width="792" height="1224" />\r\n<h4>Resident Services Poster</h4>\r\nI designed a large format poster to advertise CHH Resident Services. It primarily informs residents of the services available to them. We proposed to mount these posters on community boards in public building spaces, around the building property and within CHH offices. This poster design acts as the outward, public facing representation of the CHH Resident Services.\r\n[/image_block]\r\n<h3>Background</h3>\r\nCapitol Hill Housing Resident Service department employs Resident Service Coordinators (RSC) to inform, coordinate and provide resources to its diverse residents. The RSC primarily communicate with residents through information sheets, advertisements on community boards, door-to-door tactics, and building events and direct one-on-one contact. They serve as the central resource for all residents living in CHH properties, providing a range of services including general questions, hosting community events and coordinating need-based services such as rental assistance, live-in health care and transportation services to name a few.\r\n<h3>Project Challenges &amp; Goals</h3>\r\nAccording to CHH resident surveys, less than half the residents were aware that CHH provided individualized support through its Resident Services Program. Additionally, the RSC relied heavily on Microsoft word, so it became important to create a template system any RSC could use on any type of computer. As such, the project goals were identified as follows:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Inform residents about RSC and increase awareness of the many services available</li>\r\n 	<li>Simplify the layout and be consistent with the CHH brand</li>\r\n 	<li>Improve the collateral functionality and usability for RSC</li>\r\n 	<li>Improve and increase the visual accessibility for CHH’s diverse residents</li>\r\n 	<li>Improve and increase the trust between resident and RSC in individual communities</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Design Strategy</h3>\r\nTo achieve these goals, I brainstormed the visual design by assessing technical concerns, researching the methods in which RSC communicate with residents, and reviewing the overall brand image and messaging of CHH. To increase overall brand awareness, I set forth to develop a template system that is unique for individual properties, yet consistent with the larger CHH brand. Additionally, my deliverables were simply formatted and easily customizable for the RSC.\r\n<h3>Design Solutions</h3>\r\nThe client hired me to provide graphic design services for five collateral items most utilized by the RSC. The existing collateral was redesigned to meet the aforementioned goals into five unified, brand consistent templates:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Building Welcome Sheets</li>\r\n 	<li>RSC Persona Sheets</li>\r\n 	<li>Monthly Events Calendar</li>\r\n 	<li>Event Flyers</li>\r\n 	<li>Resource One Sheets</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n[image_block][scroller]<img class="alignnone wp-image-51 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_welcome-sheetgeneral_8.5x11.jpg" alt="" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-52 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_welcome-sheetJoeyG_8.5x11.jpg" alt="" width="612" height="792" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-34 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tmpl_individual-rsc.jpg" alt="" width="2448" height="3264" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-32 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/poster_resident-services-e1530318746544.jpg" alt="" width="2366" height="2904" />[/scroller]\r\n<h4>Building Welcome and RSC Persona Sheets</h4>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon move in, residents receive a packet which includes the building welcome and RSC persona sheets. The building welcome sheet informs residents about CHH and resources available through the Resident Services program. The RSC persona sheet introduces the specific RS Coordinator supporting the residents’ property. Both these documents are intended to welcome residents and provide them essential resources, contact information, and other important details about CHH and RSC.</span>\r\n[/image_block]\r\n\r\n[image_block][scroller]<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-53" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE-calendar_11x8.5.jpg" alt="" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-35 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tmpl_residence-calendar-e1530319018147.jpg" alt="" width="2986" height="2341" />[/scroller]\r\n<h4>Monthly Events Calendar</h4>\r\nMonthly calendars specific to each property highlight upcoming community events. They are available online, by email and posted in community spaces. After creating a 2018-19 monthly calendar template with updated styles, I added additional content to the footer, for each RSC and building property. This allows the RSC to put their contact information and specific building information on the calendars for residents to easily reference.\r\n[/image_block]\r\n\r\n[image_block][scroller]<img class="alignnone wp-image-48 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_event-poster_8.5x11.jpg" alt="" width="612" height="792" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-47 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/BLANK_event-flyer_x2_5.5x8.5.jpg" alt="" width="2200" height="1700" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-33 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tmpl_event-flyers-e1530319332673.jpg" alt="" width="2325" height="2986" />[/scroller]\r\n<h4>Event Flyers</h4>\r\nEvent flyers posted in community spaces advertise a variety of events and workshops. For maximum ease of use and flexibility, I designed a variable sidebar layout for things like recurrent dates and event sign-ups. RSCs can choose between having a single event date or multiple recurring events, both, or neither.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, there is an option for a sign-up content block with a variable height, allowing for maximum customization. I also created a half-sheet event template that reduces event information to its hook, a primary message and call to action, for use by the RSC as handouts for local, building specific events.\r\n[/image_block]\r\n\r\n[image_block][scroller]<img class="alignnone wp-image-50 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_resource-one-sheet_8.5x11.jpg" alt="" width="1700" height="2200" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-36 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tmpl_resource-one-sheet-e1530319531779.jpg" alt="" width="2309" height="2888" />[/scroller]\r\n<h4>Resource One Sheets</h4>\r\nThese templates list all relevant contact information for each resource category. I created a typographic system and grid layout that adapts to each collateral template. The system I conceived maintains the appropriate balance between text legibility and readability. This one sheet example is the simplest form of typography and grid layout utilized across every template.\r\n[/image_block]\r\n<h3>Design Process</h3>\r\nThe challenges and client\'s goals were kept at the forefront of my process while designing the collateral. During each step of the project, the following were considered: consistency; accessibility; and usability.\r\n<h4>Consistency</h4>\r\nConsistency affects people’s awareness and trust of a brand. If residents aren’t clear what the RSC provide and who they are in relation to CHH, then they are likely to have less faith in the services provided. I directly addressed this issue through a systematically implemented visual design. Through use of typography, white space, graphic elements and color, I achieved overall visual consistency between all collateral templates.\r\n<h4>Accessibility</h4>\r\nThe visual design complements the content strategy and does not detract from it. We simplified the text and used language understood by a general audience. I also utilized a relatively large font size to improve legibility and tested the color contrast, to ensure residents with visual impairments could view the content.\r\n<h4>Usability</h4>\r\nTo provide maximum ease of use for the RSC, who may not have a background in design or layout programs, I chose Adobe InDesign to make the templates. The Adobe InDesign has excellent interface with Adobe Acrobat, a program used by the majority of CHH employees. This resulted in great ease of use for the RSC, allowing for editable content while maintaining overall brand consistency.\r\n<h3>Project Results</h3>\r\nThe overall response from the Client, CHH employees, Resident Service Coordinators and residents was overwhelmingly positive. The visual design and functionality of my project deliverables exceeded their expectations. In fact, after using the new templates, several RSC requested more variations for the event flyers, resulting in additional project work.\r\n\r\nWhile redesigning the RSC collateral, I created a visual design inspired by the existing CHH brand. It maintained the familiarity of the old styles, while drastically improving RSC brand accessibility, usability, and consistency. Our focus on content strategy, language and visual harmony allowed the collateral to accommodate the diverse audiences with propriety and appeal.\r\n\r\n[scroller]\r\n<img class="alignnone wp-image-71 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/IMG_3094_small.jpg" alt="Capitol Hill Housing community event" width="500" height="333" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-90 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/IMG_2666.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="1600" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-89 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/IMG_2499.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="1200" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-70 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CAPHILLHOUSING-186-1.jpg" alt="Ashwin Warrior enters the Capitol Hill Housing offices on 12th Ave." width="3000" height="2000" />[/scroller]', 'Capitol Hill Housing Resident Services', 'The Capitol Hill Housing Resident Services department needed brand collateral redesign, in response to many residents indicating they are unaware of Resident Services Coordinators and the resources they provide.', 'publish', 'closed', 'open', '', 'capitol-hill-housing-resident-services', '', '', '2018-07-24 06:41:00', '2018-07-24 06:41:00', '', 0, 'http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/?p=23', 0, 'post', '', 0),

This project is a unique and diverse partnership of many community members and groups that work together to make affordable housing more accessible to individuals, groups and families who are susceptible to the consequences of rapid urban development occurring in the CD.\r\n<h3>Design Problem &amp; Project Goals</h3>\r\nCurrent information about the leasing process for the Liberty Bank Building is complex, lengthy, and inaccessible to individuals most in need of this very information. Consequently, there has been misinformation spreading about how the application process works for the Liberty Bank Building.\r\n\r\nThe project goals are to clarify the eligibility requirements for affordable housing, explain the application process for leasing at the Liberty Bank Building, and affirmatively target audiences affected by rapidly rising rent in the CD. This will be achieved through a leasing packet design that is intuitive and\r\nsimply explains the affordable housing application process, and will include the following deliverables:\r\n<h3>Deliverables</h3>\r\n(a single packet of the following items)\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Overview / timeline document, (similar to the one produced by NY Housing Connect )</li>\r\n 	<li>FAQs document</li>\r\n 	<li>General leasing flyer with building features, photos, location map, and income requirements</li>\r\n 	<li>Income limit sheet (similar to the one produced by NY Housing Connect )</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Successes &amp; Failures</h3>\r\n<h4>Audience</h4>\r\n<h5>Primary</h5>\r\nIndividuals and families living in the CD who qualify for affordable housing and those who are looking for clear information on the leasing process and how to apply for the Liberty Bank Building affordable housing units.\r\n<h5>Secondary</h5>\r\nCommunity members and small businesses, particularly of pan-african decent, affected by displacement in the CD; or those individuals and community partners at risk of being unable to afford rapid rent increases in the CD’s housing and commercial real estate market.\r\n<h4>Relationships</h4>\r\n<h5>Client – LBB Building Partners</h5>\r\nThe Capitol Hill Housing Association ensures their approach to each community building is both intentional and affective in targeting individuals in need of affordable housing. For this project the Liberty Bank Partners _____.\r\n(something about how this collateral strengthened the LBB partners trust in CHH’s ability to be aware of its context and deliver content that is relevant to this project’s audience).\r\n<h5>Client – Designer</h5>\r\nThe client will primarily be a resource for information, questions, and any background material required for the designer to create the requested deliverables. The client and their affiliates will also serve as a\r\ncritical observer of all copy and design material. The client will share responsibility in previewing the copy and designed deliverables throughout the design process, including critical points in the timeline\r\nlike presentations and check-ins.

After a completing a survey of property residents, CHH found that a majority of residents were not aware that CHH offers additional services through their Resident Service Coordinators. We presumed this lack of awareness was in part due to their inconsistent templates and methods used to reaching residents.\r\n<h4>Accessibility and Consistency</h4>\r\nAnother concern Ashwin approached me about was their reliance on Microsoft Word templates.

The potential viewing audience for this project spans generations of experience and understand. Given this, I did not want the visual content to distract at all from the text content. More importantly, the text content needed to be simplified to its critical points and written in a way that is accessible to the diverse audience. <strong>(Did I succeed?)</strong>\r\n<h4>Delivery Methods</h4>\r\nThe RS Coordinator\'s primary means of communication with property residents is through information sheets and advertisements given out at CHH offices, community boards in public building spaces on CHH properties, door-to-door tactics and community building events, and through one on one contact with RSC\'s.', 'Capitol Hill Housing', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '23-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-06-30 03:39:58', '2018-06-30 03:39:58', '', 23, 'http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/23-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

We proposed to mount these on community boards in public building spaces, around the building property, and will be used primarily to inform residents of the services available. It also supported resident place-making; by giving the CHH property a uniform image, residents are projected to understand the network of support provided by CHH and RSC\'s.\r\n<h4>Resource One Sheet Template</h4>\r\nThe template is very similar to the original template.

This one sheet example is the simplest form of typography and grid layout used across all the templates.\r\n<h4>Calendar Template</h4>\r\nAfter creating a 2018-19 monthly calendar template with updated styles, I added additional content to the footer, specific to each RSC and property.

Consequentially, I designed a variable sidebar layout for things like recurrent event dates and event sign ups. RSC\'s are able to choose between having a single event data or multiple recurring events. Additionally, there is an option for a sign-up content block with a variable height allowing for more or less sign-up lines.\r\n\r\nI also made a print-off half-sheet event template that synthesizes event information to its primary message and call to action.\r\n<h3>Design Impact</h3>\r\nThe general response from the CHH Resident Service Coordinators was positive.\r\n<h3>Successes &amp; Failures</h3>\r\nAccording to the 2016 CHH annual resident survey, less than half all residents in CHH properties are aware that CHH provides individualize support through their Resident Services program. With this in mind, the primary goal was to design content that informed residents of their Resident Services Coordinators and the Resident Services available through CHH. In order to achieve this, I thought strategically about the visual design and the delivery methods to optimize the RSC\'s collateral rebrand impact.\r\n<h4>Visual Design</h4>\r\nCHH manages about 50 separate properties each with individual eligibility requirements that support a range of residents from, low-income, elderly, disabled, veterans, and other eligibility restricted units. The potential viewing audience for this project spans generations of experience and understand. Given this, I did not want the visual content to distract at all from the text content. More importantly, the text content needed to be simplified to its critical points and written in a way that is accessible to the diverse audience. <strong>(Did I succeed?)</strong>\r\n<h4>Delivery Methods</h4>\r\nThe RS Coordinator\'s primary means of communication with property residents is through information sheets and advertisements given out at CHH offices, community boards in public building spaces on CHH properties, door-to-door tactics and community building events, and through one on one contact with RSC\'s.', 'Capitol Hill Housing', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '23-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-06-30 04:34:38', '2018-06-30 04:34:38', '', 23, 'http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/23-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

After a completing a survey of property residents, CHH found that a majority of residents were not aware that CHH offers additional services through their Resident Service Coordinators. We presumed this lack of awareness was in part due to their inconsistent templates and delivery methods used to reaching residents.\r\n<h4>Accessibility and Consistency</h4>\r\nAnother concern Ashwin approached me about was their reliance on Microsoft Word templates. This was a problem because these same templates were being used by other City government entities, like the Public Library. This overlap in branding between government agencies clouded the CHH brand and was a key factor in CHH wanting to unify their brand image and messaging in order to stand up for the community.\r\n\r\nResident Services Coordinators (RSC) are the central resource for residents living in CHH properties.

These templates needed to be easily accessible/editable, simply formatted, and customizable for RSC’s to implement in each of their unique communities.\r\n<h3>Existing Collateral</h3>\r\nAshwin presented me with five collateral items the RSC\'s used most:\r\n\r\n[scroller]<img class="alignnone wp-image-32 size-large" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/poster_resident-services-e1530318746544-834x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="786" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-34 size-large" style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, \'Segoe UI\', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, \'Helvetica Neue\', sans-serif;" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tmpl_individual-rsc-768x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="853" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-35 size-large" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tmpl_residence-calendar-e1530319018147-1024x803.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="502" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-33 size-large" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tmpl_event-flyers-e1530319332673-797x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="822" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-36 size-large" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tmpl_resource-one-sheet-e1530319531779-819x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="800" />[/scroller]\r\n<h4>Information and Welcome Sheets</h4>\r\nA general welcome sheet given new residents that informs them about Capitol Hill Housing (CHH) and the resources that are available to them through the Resident Services program, and a Resident Service Coordinator (RSC) welcome sheet that introduces the individual RS Coordinator for the resident\'s property. Both these documents are provided to new residents upon moving in. It includes essential resources in addition to CHH and RSC\'s contact information.\r\n<h4>Monthly Event Calendar</h4>\r\nA monthly calendar specific to each building property that shows all events and key date for the property residents to be aware of. The monthly calendars are posted on community boards in public building spaces.\r\n<h4>Event Flyers</h4>\r\nEvent flyers are posted in community spaces to advertise for major events. RSC\'s also create print-off half-sheet handouts for local, building specific events, and are posted in building community spaces and on residency doors.\r\n<h4>Resource One Sheets</h4>\r\nA template that lists all relevant contact information for each resource category.\r\n<h3>Design Solutions</h3>\r\nThe unique challenge to this project was designing templates using Adobe InDesign but then making those template accessible to users who do not use InDesign regularly and go not have a background in design. I learned that CHH uses Adobe Acrobat which has excellent capability with InDesign. By exporting the templates as an <em>interactive PDF</em>, any RSC may copy the template PDF and edit the image and text content while maintain consistency across the branding.\r\n<h4>Deliverables</h4>\r\nEach of the below templates have the customizable features:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>CHH brand color schemes and font options</li>\r\n 	<li>text blocks that maintain text styles</li>\r\n 	<li>image blocks maintain position and crop boundary, but allow custom image scaling and positioning within the crop boundary</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n[scroller]\r\n<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-49" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_Resident-Services-poster_11x17.jpg" alt="" />\r\n<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_resource-one-sheet_8.5x11.jpg" alt="" />\r\n<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-53" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE-calendar_11x8.5.jpg" alt="" />\r\n<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_welcome-sheetgeneral_8.5x11.jpg" alt="" />\r\n<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_welcome-sheetJoeyG_8.5x11.jpg" alt="" />\r\n<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_event-poster_8.5x11.jpg" alt="" />\r\n<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/BLANK_event-flyer_x2_5.5x8.5.jpg" alt="" />\r\n[/scroller]\r\n<h4>Resident Services Poster</h4>\r\nIn addition to the five collateral templates Ashwin provided me, we proposed to design a large format poster to use to advertise to residents. We proposed to mount these on community boards in public building spaces, around the building property, and will be used primarily to inform residents of the services available. It also supported resident place-making; by giving the CHH property a uniform image, residents are projected to understand the network of support provided by CHH and RSC\'s.\r\n<h4>Resource One Sheet Template</h4>\r\nThe template is very similar to the original template. From the beginning I worked out a typographic system and grid layout that is adaptable to each collateral template created. This one sheet example is the simplest form of typography and grid layout used across all the templates.\r\n<h4>Calendar Template</h4>\r\nAfter creating a 2018-19 monthly calendar template with updated styles, I added additional content to the footer, specific to each RSC and property. This allowed each RSC to put their contact information and the building information on the calendar.\r\n<h4>Building Welcome Template</h4>\r\nThe general  building welcome sheet is given to new residents and includes a welcoming message, important contact information, and more detailed information along a sidebar.\r\n<h4>Welcome Home, RSC Persona Template</h4>\r\nThe RSC persona template is similar to the building welcome template. It is also given to new residents in a move in packet, and contains an inviting introduction plus essential contact information.\r\n<h4>Event Ad Templates</h4>\r\nThe event templates are used for a variety of community events and workshops. Consequentially, I designed a variable sidebar layout for things like recurrent event dates and event sign ups. RSC\'s are able to choose between having a single event data or multiple recurring events. Additionally, there is an option for a sign-up content block with a variable height allowing for more or less sign-up lines.\r\n\r\nI also made a print-off half-sheet event template that synthesizes event information to its primary message and call to action.\r\n<h3>Design Impact</h3>\r\nThe general response from Ashwin, the CHH employees, Resident Service Coordinators and few residents was overwhelmingly positive. Given the visual design of collateral prior to my involvement, the impression of the deliverables exceeded the established expectations.\r\n\r\nAccording to the 2016 CHH annual resident survey, less than half all residents in CHH properties are aware that CHH provides individualize support through their Resident Services program. With this in mind, we established three goals to guide the design. 1) to informs residents of the Resident Services Coordinators and make them aware of the Resident Services available through CHH, 2) to re-design collateral templates, to simplify the layout to be consistent with the CHH brand, and 3) to improve collateral accessibility, both for the RSC\'s using the templates to create collateral and for a diverse audience of residents. In order to achieve these goals, I thought strategically about the visual design and the delivery methods to optimize the RSC\'s collateral rebrand impact.\r\n<h4>Visual Design</h4>\r\nHow did this help achieve the goals above?\r\n\r\nI did not want the visual content to distract at all from the text content.

These templates needed to be easily accessible/editable, simply formatted, and customizable for RSC’s to implement in each of their unique communities.\r\n<h3>Existing Collateral</h3>\r\nAshwin presented me with five collateral items the RSC\'s used most:\r\n\r\n[scroller]<img class="alignnone wp-image-32 size-large" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/poster_resident-services-e1530318746544-834x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="786" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-34 size-large" style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, \'Segoe UI\', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, \'Helvetica Neue\', sans-serif;" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tmpl_individual-rsc-768x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="853" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-35 size-large" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tmpl_residence-calendar-e1530319018147-1024x803.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="502" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-33 size-large" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tmpl_event-flyers-e1530319332673-797x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="822" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-36 size-large" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tmpl_resource-one-sheet-e1530319531779-819x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="800" />[/scroller]\r\n<h4>Information and Welcome Sheets</h4>\r\nA general welcome sheet given new residents that informs them about Capitol Hill Housing (CHH) and the resources that are available to them through the Resident Services program, and a Resident Service Coordinator (RSC) welcome sheet that introduces the individual RS Coordinator for the resident\'s property. Both these documents are provided to new residents upon moving in. It includes essential resources in addition to CHH and RSC\'s contact information.\r\n<h4>Monthly Event Calendar</h4>\r\nA monthly calendar specific to each building property that shows all events and key date for the property residents to be aware of. The monthly calendars are posted on community boards in public building spaces.\r\n<h4>Event Flyers</h4>\r\nEvent flyers are posted in community spaces to advertise for major events.

We proposed to mount these on community boards in public building spaces, around the building property, and will be used primarily to inform residents of the services available. It also supported resident place-making; by giving the CHH property a uniform image, residents are projected to understand the network of support provided by CHH and RSC\'s.\r\n<h4>Resource One Sheet Template</h4>\r\nThe template is very similar to the original template. From the beginning I worked out a typographic system and grid layout that is adaptable to each collateral template created. This one sheet example is the simplest form of typography and grid layout used across all the templates.\r\n<h4>Calendar Template</h4>\r\nAfter creating a 2018-19 monthly calendar template with updated styles, I added additional content to the footer, specific to each RSC and property. This allowed each RSC to put their contact information and the building information on the calendar.\r\n<h4>Building Welcome Template</h4>\r\nThe general  building welcome sheet is given to new residents and includes a welcoming message, important contact information, and more detailed information along a sidebar.\r\n<h4>Welcome Home, RSC Persona Template</h4>\r\nThe RSC persona template is similar to the building welcome template. It is also given to new residents in a move in packet, and contains an inviting introduction plus essential contact information.\r\n<h4>Event Ad Templates</h4>\r\nThe event templates are used for a variety of community events and workshops. Consequentially, I designed a variable sidebar layout for things like recurrent event dates and event sign ups. RSC\'s are able to choose between having a single event data or multiple recurring events. Additionally, there is an option for a sign-up content block with a variable height allowing for more or less sign-up lines.\r\n\r\nI also made a print-off half-sheet event template that synthesizes event information to its primary message and call to action.\r\n<h3>Design Solutions and Impact</h3>\r\nThe general response from Ashwin, the CHH employees, Resident Service Coordinators and few residents was overwhelmingly positive. Given the visual design of collateral prior to my involvement, the impression of the deliverables exceeded the established expectations.\r\n\r\nAccording to the 2016 CHH annual resident survey, less than half all residents in CHH properties are aware that CHH provides individualize support through their Resident Services program. With this in mind, we established three goals to guide the design. 1) to informs residents of the Resident Services Coordinators and make them aware of the Resident Services available through CHH, 2) to re-design collateral templates, to simplify the layout to be consistent with the CHH brand, and 3) to improve collateral accessibility, both for the RSC\'s using the templates to create collateral and for a diverse audience of residents. In order to achieve these goals, I thought strategically about the visual design and the delivery methods to optimize the RSC\'s collateral rebrand impact.\r\n<h4>Visual Design</h4>\r\n<em>How did this help achieve the goals above?</em>\r\n\r\nI did not want the visual content to distract at all from the text content. More importantly, the text content needed to be simplified to its critical points and written in a way that is accessible to the diverse audience.\r\n<h4>Delivery Methods</h4>\r\nThe unique challenge to this project was designing templates using Adobe InDesign but then making those template accessible to users who do not use InDesign regularly and go not have a background in design. I learned that CHH uses Adobe Acrobat which has excellent capability with InDesign. By exporting the templates as an <em>interactive PDF</em>, any RSC may copy the template PDF and edit the image and text content while maintain consistency across the branding.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'Capitol Hill Housing', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '23-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-06-30 05:21:57', '2018-06-30 05:21:57', '', 23, 'http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/23-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

We proposed to mount these on community boards in public building spaces, around the building property, and will be used primarily to inform residents of the services available. It also supported resident place-making; by giving the CHH property a uniform image, residents are projected to understand the network of support provided by CHH and RSC\'s.\r\n<h4>Resource One Sheet Template</h4>\r\nThe template is very similar to the original template. From the beginning I worked out a typographic system and grid layout that is adaptable to each collateral template created. This one sheet example is the simplest form of typography and grid layout used across all the templates.\r\n<h4>Calendar Template</h4>\r\nAfter creating a 2018-19 monthly calendar template with updated styles, I added additional content to the footer, specific to each RSC and property. This allowed each RSC to put their contact information and the building information on the calendar.\r\n<h4>Building Welcome Template</h4>\r\nThe general  building welcome sheet is given to new residents and includes a welcoming message, important contact information, and more detailed information along a sidebar.\r\n<h4>Welcome Home, RSC Persona Template</h4>\r\nThe RSC persona template is similar to the building welcome template. It is also given to new residents in a move in packet, and contains an inviting introduction plus essential contact information.\r\n<h4>Event Ad Templates</h4>\r\nThe event templates are used for a variety of community events and workshops. Consequentially, I designed a variable sidebar layout for things like recurrent event dates and event sign ups. RSC\'s are able to choose between having a single event data or multiple recurring events. Additionally, there is an option for a sign-up content block with a variable height allowing for more or less sign-up lines.\r\n\r\nI also made a print-off half-sheet event template that synthesizes event information to its primary message and call to action.\r\n<h3>Design Solutions and Impact</h3>\r\nThe general response from Ashwin, the CHH employees, Resident Service Coordinators and few residents was overwhelmingly positive. Given the visual design of collateral prior to my involvement, the impression of the deliverables exceeded the established expectations.\r\n\r\nAccording to the 2016 CHH annual resident survey, less than half all residents in CHH properties are aware that CHH provides individualize support through their Resident Services program. With this in mind, we established three goals to guide the design. 1) to informs residents of the Resident Services Coordinators and make them aware of the Resident Services available through CHH, 2) to re-design collateral templates, to simplify the layout to be consistent with the CHH brand, and 3) to improve collateral accessibility, both for the RSC\'s using the templates to create collateral and for a diverse audience of residents. In order to achieve these goals, I thought strategically about the visual design and the delivery methods to optimize the RSC\'s collateral rebrand impact.\r\n<h4>Visual Design</h4>\r\nHow did this help achieve the goals above?\r\n\r\nI did not want the visual content to distract at all from the text content. More importantly, the text content needed to be simplified to its critical points and written in a way that is accessible to the diverse audience.\r\n<h4>Delivery Methods</h4>\r\nThe unique challenge to this project was designing templates using Adobe InDesign but then making those template accessible to users who do not use InDesign regularly and go not have a background in design. I learned that CHH uses Adobe Acrobat which has excellent capability with InDesign. By exporting the templates as an <em>interactive PDF</em>, any RSC may copy the template PDF and edit the image and text content while maintain consistency across the branding.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'Capitol Hill Housing', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '23-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-06-30 06:44:41', '2018-06-30 06:44:41', '', 23, 'http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/23-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0) ;

Their mission is to build vibrant and engaged communities through affordable housing and community development. They own and manage 48 affordable properties throughout the Seattle area, serving low- and moderate-income residents and work to improve neighborhoods for all of Seattle since 1976.\r\n\r\n<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-80" style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, \'Segoe UI\', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, \'Helvetica Neue\', sans-serif;" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHH-Logo-300x96.jpg" alt="Capitol Hill Housing, logo" />\r\n<h2>The Resident Services Department</h2>\r\nResident Services at Capitol Hill Housing exists to provide its residents with community resources, referrals to supportive services, and community support for each building and property.\r\n<h3>Design Background</h3>\r\nCHH manages about 50 separate properties each with individual eligibility requirements that support a range of residents from, low-income, elderly, disabled, veterans, and other eligibility restricted units. The potential viewing audience for this project spans generations of experience and understanding.\r\n\r\nCHH uses Site Managers to help manage properties and Resident Service Coordinator\'s (RSC) to inform, coordinate and provide a variety of resources for residents.\r\n\r\nThe RSC\'s primary means of communication with property residents is through information sheets and advertisements given out at CHH offices, community boards in public building spaces on CHH properties, door-to-door tactics and community building events, and through one on one contact with RSC\'s.\r\n<h3>Design problems</h3>\r\n<h4>Awareness</h4>\r\nThe Senior Communications Manager at CHH, Ashwin Warrior, contacted me in need of some brand collateral development for the Resident Services department. After a completing a survey of property residents, CHH found that a majority of residents were not aware that CHH offers additional services through their Resident Service Coordinators. We presumed this lack of awareness was in part due to their inconsistent templates and delivery methods used to reaching residents.\r\n<h4>Accessibility and Consistency</h4>\r\nAnother concern Ashwin approached me about was their reliance on Microsoft Word templates. This was a problem because these same templates were being used by other City government entities, like the Public Library. This overlap in branding between government agencies clouded the CHH brand and was a key factor in CHH wanting to unify their brand image and messaging in order to stand up for the community.\r\n\r\nResident Services Coordinators (RSC) are the central resource for residents living in CHH properties. RSC’s will help residents with anything from answering a community question, hosting a community event, to receiving need based services like rental assistance, live-in health care, transportation services, and much more.\r\n\r\nGiven the broad scope of services and experience, it was paramount to create a templates that anyone could open and use on any computer, without much knowledge of typography and design layout, while still creating something unique to their community building and consistent with the larger CHH brand. These templates needed to be easily accessible/editable, simply formatted, and customizable for RSC’s to implement in each of their unique communities.\r\n<h3>Existing Collateral</h3>\r\nAshwin presented me with five collateral items the RSC\'s used most:\r\n\r\n[scroller]<img class="alignnone wp-image-32 size-large" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/poster_resident-services-e1530318746544-834x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="786" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-34 size-large" style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, \'Segoe UI\', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, \'Helvetica Neue\', sans-serif;" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tmpl_individual-rsc-768x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="853" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-35 size-large" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tmpl_residence-calendar-e1530319018147-1024x803.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="502" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-33 size-large" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tmpl_event-flyers-e1530319332673-797x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="822" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-36 size-large" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tmpl_resource-one-sheet-e1530319531779-819x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="800" />[/scroller]\r\n<h4>Information and Welcome Sheets</h4>\r\nA general welcome sheet given new residents that informs them about Capitol Hill Housing (CHH) and the resources that are available to them through the Resident Services program, and a Resident Service Coordinator (RSC) welcome sheet that introduces the individual RS Coordinator for the resident\'s property.

After a completing a survey of property residents, CHH found that a majority of residents were not aware that CHH offers additional services through their Resident Service Coordinators. We presumed this lack of awareness was in part due to their inconsistent templates and delivery methods used to reaching residents.\r\n<h4>Accessibility and Consistency</h4>\r\nAnother concern Ashwin approached me about was their reliance on Microsoft Word templates. This was a problem because these same templates were being used by other City government entities, like the Public Library. This overlap in branding between government agencies clouded the CHH brand and was a key factor in CHH wanting to unify their brand image and messaging in order to stand up for the community.\r\n\r\nResident Services Coordinators (RSC) are the central resource for residents living in CHH properties. RSC’s will help residents with anything from answering a community question, hosting a community event, to receiving need based services like rental assistance, live-in health care, transportation services, and much more.\r\n\r\nGiven the broad scope of services and experience, it was paramount to create a templates that anyone could open and use on any computer, without much knowledge of typography and design layout, while still creating something unique to their community building and consistent with the larger CHH brand. These templates needed to be easily accessible/editable, simply formatted, and customizable for RSC’s to implement in each of their unique communities.\r\n<h3>Existing Collateral</h3>\r\nAshwin presented me with five collateral items the RSC\'s used most:\r\n\r\n[scroller]<img class="alignnone wp-image-32 size-large" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/poster_resident-services-e1530318746544-834x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="786" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-34 size-large" style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, \'Segoe UI\', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, \'Helvetica Neue\', sans-serif;" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tmpl_individual-rsc-768x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="853" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-35 size-large" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tmpl_residence-calendar-e1530319018147-1024x803.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="502" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-33 size-large" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tmpl_event-flyers-e1530319332673-797x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="822" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-36 size-large" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tmpl_resource-one-sheet-e1530319531779-819x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="800" />[/scroller]\r\n<h4>Information and Welcome Sheets</h4>\r\nA general welcome sheet given new residents that informs them about Capitol Hill Housing (CHH) and the resources that are available to them through the Resident Services program, and a Resident Service Coordinator (RSC) welcome sheet that introduces the individual RS Coordinator for the resident\'s property. Both these documents are provided to new residents upon moving in. It includes essential resources in addition to CHH and RSC\'s contact information.\r\n<h4>Monthly Event Calendar</h4>\r\nA monthly calendar specific to each building property that shows all events and key date for the property residents to be aware of. The monthly calendars are posted on community boards in public building spaces.\r\n<h4>Event Flyers</h4>\r\nEvent flyers are posted in community spaces to advertise for major events. RSC\'s also create print-off half-sheet handouts for local, building specific events, and are posted in building community spaces and on residency doors.\r\n<h4>Resource One Sheets</h4>\r\nA template that lists all relevant contact information for each resource category.\r\n<h3>Re-Designed Deliverables</h3>\r\nEach of the below templates have the customizable features:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>CHH brand color schemes and font options</li>\r\n 	<li>text blocks that maintain text styles</li>\r\n 	<li>image blocks maintain position and crop boundary, but allow custom image scaling and positioning within the crop boundary</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n[scroller]\r\n<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-49" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_Resident-Services-poster_11x17.jpg" alt="" />\r\n<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_resource-one-sheet_8.5x11.jpg" alt="" />\r\n<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-53" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE-calendar_11x8.5.jpg" alt="" />\r\n<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_welcome-sheetgeneral_8.5x11.jpg" alt="" />\r\n<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_welcome-sheetJoeyG_8.5x11.jpg" alt="" />\r\n<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_event-poster_8.5x11.jpg" alt="" />\r\n<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/BLANK_event-flyer_x2_5.5x8.5.jpg" alt="" />\r\n[/scroller]\r\n<h4>Resident Services Poster</h4>\r\nIn addition to the five collateral templates Ashwin provided me, we proposed to design a large format poster to use to advertise to residents. We proposed to mount these on community boards in public building spaces, around the building property, and will be used primarily to inform residents of the services available. It also supported resident place-making; by giving the CHH property a uniform image, residents are projected to understand the network of support provided by CHH and RSC\'s.\r\n<h4>Resource One Sheet Template</h4>\r\nThe template is very similar to the original template. From the beginning I worked out a typographic system and grid layout that is adaptable to each collateral template created. This one sheet example is the simplest form of typography and grid layout used across all the templates.\r\n<h4>Calendar Template</h4>\r\nAfter creating a 2018-19 monthly calendar template with updated styles, I added additional content to the footer, specific to each RSC and property. This allowed each RSC to put their contact information and the building information on the calendar.\r\n<h4>Building Welcome Template</h4>\r\nThe general  building welcome sheet is given to new residents and includes a welcoming message, important contact information, and more detailed information along a sidebar.\r\n<h4>Welcome Home, RSC Persona Template</h4>\r\nThe RSC persona template is similar to the building welcome template. It is also given to new residents in a move in packet, and contains an inviting introduction plus essential contact information.\r\n<h4>Event Ad Templates</h4>\r\nThe event templates are used for a variety of community events and workshops. Consequentially, I designed a variable sidebar layout for things like recurrent event dates and event sign ups. RSC\'s are able to choose between having a single event data or multiple recurring events. Additionally, there is an option for a sign-up content block with a variable height allowing for more or less sign-up lines.\r\n\r\nI also made a print-off half-sheet event template that synthesizes event information to its primary message and call to action.\r\n<h3>Design Solutions and Impact</h3>\r\nThe general response from Ashwin, the CHH employees, Resident Service Coordinators and few residents was overwhelmingly positive. Given the visual design of collateral prior to my involvement, the impression of the deliverables exceeded the established expectations.\r\n\r\nAccording to the 2016 CHH annual resident survey, less than half all residents in CHH properties are aware that CHH provides individualize support through their Resident Services program. With this in mind, we established three goals to guide the design. 1) to informs residents of the Resident Services Coordinators and make them aware of the Resident Services available through CHH, 2) to re-design collateral templates, to simplify the layout to be consistent with the CHH brand, and 3) to improve collateral accessibility, both for the RSC\'s using the templates to create collateral and for a diverse audience of residents. In order to achieve these goals, I thought strategically about the visual design and the delivery methods to optimize the RSC\'s collateral rebrand impact.\r\n<h4>Visual Design</h4>\r\nHow did this help achieve the goals above?\r\n\r\nI did not want the visual content to distract at all from the text content. More importantly, the text content needed to be simplified to its critical points and written in a way that is accessible to the diverse audience.\r\n<h4>Delivery Methods</h4>\r\nThe unique challenge to this project was designing templates using Adobe InDesign but then making those template accessible to users who do not use InDesign regularly and go not have a background in design. I learned that CHH uses Adobe Acrobat which has excellent capability with InDesign. By exporting the templates as an <em>interactive PDF</em>, any RSC may copy the template PDF and edit the image and text content while maintain consistency across the branding.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'Capitol Hill Housing', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '23-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-06-30 06:46:10', '2018-06-30 06:46:10', '', 23, 'http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/23-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

These templates needed to be easily accessible/editable, simply formatted, and customizable for RSC’s to implement in each of their unique communities.\r\n<h3>Existing Collateral</h3>\r\nAshwin presented me with five collateral items the RSC\'s used most:\r\n\r\n[scroller]<img class="alignnone wp-image-32 size-large" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/poster_resident-services-e1530318746544-834x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="786" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-34 size-large" style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, \'Segoe UI\', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, \'Helvetica Neue\', sans-serif;" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tmpl_individual-rsc-768x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="853" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-35 size-large" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tmpl_residence-calendar-e1530319018147-1024x803.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="502" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-33 size-large" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tmpl_event-flyers-e1530319332673-797x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="822" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-36 size-large" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tmpl_resource-one-sheet-e1530319531779-819x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="800" />[/scroller]\r\n<h4>Information and Welcome Sheets</h4>\r\nA general welcome sheet given new residents that informs them about Capitol Hill Housing (CHH) and the resources that are available to them through the Resident Services program, and a Resident Service Coordinator (RSC) welcome sheet that introduces the individual RS Coordinator for the resident\'s property. Both these documents are provided to new residents upon moving in. It includes essential resources in addition to CHH and RSC\'s contact information.\r\n<h4>Monthly Event Calendar</h4>\r\nA monthly calendar specific to each building property that shows all events and key date for the property residents to be aware of. The monthly calendars are posted on community boards in public building spaces.\r\n<h4>Event Flyers</h4>\r\nEvent flyers are posted in community spaces to advertise for major events. RSC\'s also create print-off half-sheet handouts for local, building specific events, and are posted in building community spaces and on residency doors.\r\n<h4>Resource One Sheets</h4>\r\nA template that lists all relevant contact information for each resource category.\r\n<h3>Re-Designed Deliverables</h3>\r\nEach of the below templates have the customizable features:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>CHH brand color schemes and font options</li>\r\n 	<li>text blocks that maintain text styles</li>\r\n 	<li>image blocks maintain position and crop boundary, but allow custom image scaling and positioning within the crop boundary</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n[scroller]\r\n<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-49" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_Resident-Services-poster_11x17.jpg" alt="" />\r\n<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_resource-one-sheet_8.5x11.jpg" alt="" />\r\n<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-53" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE-calendar_11x8.5.jpg" alt="" />\r\n<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_welcome-sheetgeneral_8.5x11.jpg" alt="" />\r\n<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_welcome-sheetJoeyG_8.5x11.jpg" alt="" />\r\n<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_event-poster_8.5x11.jpg" alt="" />\r\n<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/BLANK_event-flyer_x2_5.5x8.5.jpg" alt="" />\r\n[/scroller]\r\n<h4>Resident Services Poster</h4>\r\nIn addition to the five collateral templates Ashwin provided me, we proposed to design a large format poster to use to advertise to residents. We proposed to mount these on community boards in public building spaces, around the building property, and will be used primarily to inform residents of the services available. It also supported resident place-making; by giving the CHH property a uniform image, residents are projected to understand the network of support provided by CHH and RSC\'s.\r\n<h4>Resource One Sheet Template</h4>\r\nThe template is very similar to the original template. From the beginning I worked out a typographic system and grid layout that is adaptable to each collateral template created. This one sheet example is the simplest form of typography and grid layout used across all the templates.\r\n<h4>Calendar Template</h4>\r\nAfter creating a 2018-19 monthly calendar template with updated styles, I added additional content to the footer, specific to each RSC and property. This allowed each RSC to put their contact information and the building information on the calendar.\r\n<h4>Building Welcome Template</h4>\r\nThe general  building welcome sheet is given to new residents and includes a welcoming message, important contact information, and more detailed information along a sidebar.\r\n<h4>Welcome Home, RSC Persona Template</h4>\r\nThe RSC persona template is similar to the building welcome template. It is also given to new residents in a move in packet, and contains an inviting introduction plus essential contact information.\r\n<h4>Event Ad Templates</h4>\r\nThe event templates are used for a variety of community events and workshops. Consequentially, I designed a variable sidebar layout for things like recurrent event dates and event sign ups. RSC\'s are able to choose between having a single event data or multiple recurring events. Additionally, there is an option for a sign-up content block with a variable height allowing for more or less sign-up lines.\r\n\r\nI also made a print-off half-sheet event template that synthesizes event information to its primary message and call to action.\r\n<h3>Design Solutions and Impact</h3>\r\nThe general response from Ashwin, the CHH employees, Resident Service Coordinators and few residents was overwhelmingly positive. Given the visual design of collateral prior to my involvement, the impression of the deliverables exceeded the established expectations.\r\n\r\nAccording to the 2016 CHH annual resident survey, less than half all residents in CHH properties are aware that CHH provides individualize support through their Resident Services program. With this in mind, we established three goals to guide the design. 1) to informs residents of the Resident Services Coordinators and make them aware of the Resident Services available through CHH, 2) to re-design collateral templates, to simplify the layout to be consistent with the CHH brand, and 3) to improve collateral accessibility, both for the RSC\'s using the templates to create collateral and for a diverse audience of residents. In order to achieve these goals, I thought strategically about the visual design and the delivery methods to optimize the RSC\'s collateral rebrand impact.\r\n<h4>Visual Design</h4>\r\nHow did this help achieve the goals above?\r\n\r\nI did not want the visual content to distract at all from the text content. More importantly, the text content needed to be simplified to its critical points and written in a way that is accessible to the diverse audience.\r\n<h4>Delivery Methods</h4>\r\nThe unique challenge to this project was designing templates using Adobe InDesign but then making those template accessible to users who do not use InDesign regularly and go not have a background in design. I learned that CHH uses Adobe Acrobat which has excellent capability with InDesign. By exporting the templates as an <em>interactive PDF</em>, any RSC may copy the template PDF and edit the image and text content while maintain consistency across the branding.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'Capitol Hill Housing', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '23-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-06-30 08:23:00', '2018-06-30 08:23:00', '', 23, 'http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/23-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Their mission is to build vibrant and engaged communities through affordable housing and community development. In total, CHH manages approximately 50 properties, each with eligibility requirements ranging from low-income, elderly, disabled, veteran and other eligibility restricted units.\r\n<h3>Background</h3>\r\nCapitol Hill Housing’s Resident Service department employs Resident Service Coordinators (RSC) to inform, coordinate and provide resources to its diverse residents.   The RSC primarily communicate with residents through information sheets, advertisements on community boards, door-to-door tactics, community and building events and direct one-on-one contact. They serve as the central resource for all residents living in CHH properties, providing a range of services including general questions, hosting community events and coordinating need-based services such as rental assistance, live-in health care and transportation services to name a few.\r\n<h3>Project Challenges &amp; Goals</h3>\r\nAccording to CHH resident surveys, less than half the residents were aware that CHH provided individualized support through its Resident Services Program. Additionally, the RSC relied heavily of Microsoft word, so it became paramount to create a template system any RSC could use on any type of computer.\r\n\r\nAs such, the project goals were identified as follows:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Inform residents about RSC and increase awareness of the many services available through CHH</li>\r\n 	<li>Simplify the layout and be consistent with the CHH brand</li>\r\n 	<li>Improve the collateral functionality and usability for RSC</li>\r\n 	<li>Improve and increase the visual accessibility for CHH’s diverse residents</li>\r\n 	<li>Improve and increase the trust between resident and RSC in individual communities</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Design Strategy</h3>\r\nTo achieve the stated goals, I set about the process of brainstorming the visual design, assessing technical concerns, researching the methods in which RSC communicate with residents and the reviewing the overall brand image and messaging of CHH. To increase overall brand awareness, I set forth to unify the CHH brand image and develop a template system that could be unique for individual properties, yet consistent with the larger CHH brand. Additionally, I set forth to create pieces that were simply formatted, easily customizable and implementable by the RSC in each residential community.\r\n<h3>Design Solutions</h3>\r\nThe client hired me to provide graphic design services for five collateral items most utilized by the RSC.   The pieces were to be redesigned, while meeting the aforementioned goals in to the five unified, brand consistent templates:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Building Welcome Sheets</li>\r\n 	<li>RSC Persona Sheets</li>\r\n 	<li>Monthly Events Calendar</li>\r\n 	<li>Event Flyers</li>\r\n 	<li>Resource One Sheets</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Building Welcome and RSC Persona Sheets</h4>\r\n<em>[SCROLLER] A slideshow of collateral ashwin provided and the final design deliverable. [/SCROLLER]</em>\r\n\r\nUpon move in, residents receive a packet which includes the building welcome and RSC persona sheets. The building welcome sheet informs residents about CHH and resources available through the Resident Services program. The RSC persona sheet introduces the specific RS Coordinator supporting the residents’ property. Both these documents are intended to welcome residents and provide them essential resources, contact information, and other important details about CHH and RSC.\r\n<h4>Monthly Events Calendar</h4>\r\n<em>[SCROLLER] A slideshow of collateral ashwin provided and the final design deliverable.</em>\r\n\r\nMonthly calendars specific to each property highlight upcoming community events. They are available online, by email and posted in community spaces. After creating a 2018-19 monthly calendar template with updated styles, I added additional content to the footer, specific to each RSC and building property. This allows the RSC to put their contact information and specific building information on the calendars for residents to easily reference.\r\n<h4>Event Flyers</h4>\r\n<em>[SCROLLER] A slideshow of collateral ashwin provided and the final design deliverable.</em>\r\n\r\nEvent flyers are posted in community spaces to advertise a variety of events and workshops.

RSCs can choose between having a single event date or multiple recurring events. Additionally, there is an option for a sign-up content block with a variable height, allowing for maximum customization.   I also created a half-sheet event template that reduces event information to its hook, a primary message and call to action, for use by the RSC as handouts for local, building specific events.\r\n<h4>Resource One Sheets</h4>\r\n<em>[SCROLLER] A slideshow of collateral ashwin provided and the final design deliverable.</em>\r\n\r\nOne sheets are a template that list all relevant contact information for each resource category. I created a typographic system and grid layout that adapts to each collateral template. The system I conceived maintains the appropriate balance between text legibility and readability. This one sheet example is the simplest form of typography and grid layout utilized across every template.\r\n<h4>Resident Services Poster</h4>\r\n<em>[IMAGE_BLOCK] An emphasized display for the image with a title and description text.</em>\r\n\r\nIn addition to the five collateral templates, I designed a large format poster to advertise CHH Resident Services. It primarily informs residents of the services available to them. We proposed to mount these posters on community boards in public building spaces, around the building property and within CHH offices. This poster design acts as the outward, public facing representation of the CHH Resident Services available.\r\n<h3>Design Process</h3>\r\nIn developing the collateral pieces, the challenges and goals of the client were kept in the forefront.   As such, in all steps of the project development the following were considered: awareness and consistency; accessibility; and usability.\r\n<h4>Awareness &amp; Consistency</h4>\r\nConsistency affects people’s awareness and trust of a brand. If residents aren’t clear what the RSC provide and who they are in relation to CHH, then they are likely to have less faith in the services provided. I directly addressed this issue through a systematically implemented visual design.   Through use of typography, white space, graphic elements and color, I achieved overall visual consistency between each collateral template.\r\n<h4>Accessibility</h4>\r\nThe visual design compliments the content strategy and does not detract from it. We simplified the text and used language understood by a general audience. I also utilized a relatively large font size to improve legibility for residents with visual impairments. Attention was also paid to color usage, to increase accessibility for color visually impaired people.\r\n<h4>Usability</h4>\r\nTo provide maximum ease of use for the RSC, who may not have a background in design or layout programs, I chose Adobe InDesign to make the templates. The Adobe InDesign has excellent interface with Adobe Acrobat, the program used by the majority of CHH employees. This has resulted in great ease of use for the RSC, allowing for editable content while maintaining overall brand consistency and increased design awareness.\r\n<h3>Project Results</h3>\r\n<span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, \'Segoe UI\', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, \'Helvetica Neue\', sans-serif;">The overall response from the Client, CHH employees, Resident Service Coordinators and residents was overwhelming positive.

In recreating these design pieces for CHH, I created a visual design similar enough to the existing look to maintain the familiarity of the old styles, while drastically improving brand accessibility, functionality, consistency and awareness.

To increase overall brand awareness, I set forth to unify the CHH brand image and develop a template system that could be unique for individual properties, yet consistent with the larger CHH brand.

It primarily informs residents of the services available to them. We proposed to mount these posters on community boards in public building spaces, around the building property and within CHH offices. This poster design acts as the outward, public facing representation of the CHH Resident Services available.\r\n\r\n[/image_block]\r\n<h3>Design Process</h3>\r\nIn developing the collateral pieces, the challenges and goals of the client were kept in the forefront.   As such, in all steps of the project development the following were considered: awareness and consistency; accessibility; and usability.\r\n<h4>Awareness &amp; Consistency</h4>\r\nConsistency affects people’s awareness and trust of a brand. If residents aren’t clear what the RSC provide and who they are in relation to CHH, then they are likely to have less faith in the services provided. I directly addressed this issue through a systematically implemented visual design.   Through use of typography, white space, graphic elements and color, I achieved overall visual consistency between each collateral template.\r\n<h4>Accessibility</h4>\r\nThe visual design compliments the content strategy and does not detract from it. We simplified the text and used language understood by a general audience. I also utilized a relatively large font size to improve legibility for residents with visual impairments. Attention was also paid to color usage, to increase accessibility for color visually impaired people.\r\n<h4>Usability</h4>\r\nTo provide maximum ease of use for the RSC, who may not have a background in design or layout programs, I chose Adobe InDesign to make the templates. The Adobe InDesign has excellent interface with Adobe Acrobat, the program used by the majority of CHH employees. This has resulted in great ease of use for the RSC, allowing for editable content while maintaining overall brand consistency and increased design awareness.\r\n<h3>Project Results</h3>\r\n<span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, \'Segoe UI\', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, \'Helvetica Neue\', sans-serif;">The overall response from the Client, CHH employees, Resident Service Coordinators and residents was overwhelming positive. The visual design and functionality of my project deliverables exceeded their expectations. In fact, after using the new templates, several RSC requested more variations for the event flyers, resulting in additional project work. In recreating these design pieces for CHH, I created a visual design similar enough to the existing look to maintain the familiarity of the old styles, while drastically improving brand accessibility, functionality, consistency and awareness. Our focus on content strategy, language and visual harmony allowed the simple style to accommodate the diverse audiences with propriety and appeal.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class="alignnone wp-image-71 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/IMG_3094_small.jpg" alt="Capitol Hill Housing community event" width="500" height="333" /> <img class="alignnone wp-image-89 size-large" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/IMG_2499-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" /> <img class="alignnone wp-image-91 size-large" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/Mary-Ruth1-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" /> <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-70" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CAPHILLHOUSING-186-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="Ashwin Warrior enters the Capitol Hill Housing offices on 12th Ave." />', 'Capitol Hill Housing Resident Services', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '23-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-07-01 07:42:17', '2018-07-01 07:42:17', '', 23, 'http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/23-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0) ;

It primarily informs residents of the services available to them. We proposed to mount these posters on community boards in public building spaces, around the building property and within CHH offices. This poster design acts as the outward, public facing representation of the CHH Resident Services available.\r\n\r\n[/image_block]\r\n<h3>Design Process</h3>\r\nIn developing the collateral pieces, the challenges and goals of the client were kept in the forefront.   As such, in all steps of the project development the following were considered: awareness and consistency; accessibility; and usability.\r\n<h4>Awareness &amp; Consistency</h4>\r\nConsistency affects people’s awareness and trust of a brand. If residents aren’t clear what the RSC provide and who they are in relation to CHH, then they are likely to have less faith in the services provided. I directly addressed this issue through a systematically implemented visual design.   Through use of typography, white space, graphic elements and color, I achieved overall visual consistency between each collateral template.\r\n<h4>Accessibility</h4>\r\nThe visual design compliments the content strategy and does not detract from it. We simplified the text and used language understood by a general audience. I also utilized a relatively large font size to improve legibility for residents with visual impairments. Attention was also paid to color usage, to increase accessibility for color visually impaired people.\r\n<h4>Usability</h4>\r\nTo provide maximum ease of use for the RSC, who may not have a background in design or layout programs, I chose Adobe InDesign to make the templates. The Adobe InDesign has excellent interface with Adobe Acrobat, the program used by the majority of CHH employees. This has resulted in great ease of use for the RSC, allowing for editable content while maintaining overall brand consistency and increased design awareness.\r\n<h3>Project Results</h3>\r\n<span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, \'Segoe UI\', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, \'Helvetica Neue\', sans-serif;">The overall response from the Client, CHH employees, Resident Service Coordinators and residents was overwhelming positive. The visual design and functionality of my project deliverables exceeded their expectations. In fact, after using the new templates, several RSC requested more variations for the event flyers, resulting in additional project work. In recreating these design pieces for CHH, I created a visual design similar enough to the existing look to maintain the familiarity of the old styles, while drastically improving brand accessibility, functionality, consistency and awareness. Our focus on content strategy, language and visual harmony allowed the simple style to accommodate the diverse audiences with propriety and appeal.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class="alignnone wp-image-71 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/IMG_3094_small.jpg" alt="Capitol Hill Housing community event" width="500" height="333" /> <img class="alignnone wp-image-89 size-large" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/IMG_2499-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" /> <img class="alignnone wp-image-91 size-large" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/Mary-Ruth1-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" /> <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-70" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CAPHILLHOUSING-186-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="Ashwin Warrior enters the Capitol Hill Housing offices on 12th Ave." />', 'Capitol Hill Housing Resident Services', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '23-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-07-01 07:43:47', '2018-07-01 07:43:47', '', 23, 'http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/23-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

They serve as the central resource for all residents living in CHH properties, providing a range of services including general questions, hosting community events and coordinating need-based services such as rental assistance, live-in health care and transportation services to name a few.\r\n<h3>Project Challenges &amp; Goals</h3>\r\nAccording to CHH resident surveys, less than half the residents were aware that CHH provided individualized support through its Resident Services Program. Additionally, the RSC relied heavily of Microsoft word, so it became paramount to create a template system any RSC could use on any type of computer. As such, the project goals were identified as follows:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Inform residents about RSC and increase awareness of the many services available through CHH</li>\r\n 	<li>Simplify the layout and be consistent with the CHH brand</li>\r\n 	<li>Improve the collateral functionality and usability for RSC</li>\r\n 	<li>Improve and increase the visual accessibility for CHH’s diverse residents</li>\r\n 	<li>Improve and increase the trust between resident and RSC in individual communities</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Design Strategy</h3>\r\nTo achieve the stated goals, I set about the process of brainstorming the visual design, assessing technical concerns, researching the methods in which RSC communicate with residents and the reviewing the overall brand image and messaging of CHH. To increase overall brand awareness, I set forth to unify the CHH brand image and develop a template system that could be unique for individual properties, yet consistent with the larger CHH brand. Additionally, I set forth to create pieces that were simply formatted, easily customizable and implementable by the RSC in each residential community.\r\n<h3>Design Solutions</h3>\r\nThe client hired me to provide graphic design services for five collateral items most utilized by the RSC.   The pieces were to be redesigned, while meeting the aforementioned goals in to the five unified, brand consistent templates:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Building Welcome Sheets</li>\r\n 	<li>RSC Persona Sheets</li>\r\n 	<li>Monthly Events Calendar</li>\r\n 	<li>Event Flyers</li>\r\n 	<li>Resource One Sheets</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n[image_block][scroller]<img class="alignnone wp-image-34 size-large" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tmpl_individual-rsc-768x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="853" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-32 size-large" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/poster_resident-services-e1530318746544-834x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="786" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-51 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_welcome-sheetgeneral_8.5x11.jpg" alt="" width="612" height="792" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-52 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_welcome-sheetJoeyG_8.5x11.jpg" alt="" width="612" height="792" />[/scroller]\r\n<h4>Building Welcome and RSC Persona Sheets</h4>\r\nUpon move in, residents receive a packet which includes the building welcome and RSC persona sheets.

If residents aren’t clear what the RSC provide and who they are in relation to CHH, then they are likely to have less faith in the services provided. I directly addressed this issue through a systematically implemented visual design.   Through use of typography, white space, graphic elements and color, I achieved overall visual consistency between each collateral template.\r\n<h4>Accessibility</h4>\r\nThe visual design compliments the content strategy and does not detract from it. We simplified the text and used language understood by a general audience. I also utilized a relatively large font size to improve legibility for residents with visual impairments. Attention was also paid to color usage, to increase accessibility for color visually impaired people.\r\n<h4>Usability</h4>\r\nTo provide maximum ease of use for the RSC, who may not have a background in design or layout programs, I chose Adobe InDesign to make the templates. The Adobe InDesign has excellent interface with Adobe Acrobat, the program used by the majority of CHH employees. This has resulted in great ease of use for the RSC, allowing for editable content while maintaining overall brand consistency and increased design awareness.\r\n<h3>Project Results</h3>\r\n<span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, \'Segoe UI\', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, \'Helvetica Neue\', sans-serif;">The overall response from the Client, CHH employees, Resident Service Coordinators and residents was overwhelming positive. The visual design and functionality of my project deliverables exceeded their expectations. In fact, after using the new templates, several RSC requested more variations for the event flyers, resulting in additional project work. In recreating these design pieces for CHH, I created a visual design similar enough to the existing look to maintain the familiarity of the old styles, while drastically improving brand accessibility, functionality, consistency and awareness. Our focus on content strategy, language and visual harmony allowed the simple style to accommodate the diverse audiences with propriety and appeal.</span>\r\n\r\n[scroller]<img class="alignnone wp-image-71 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/IMG_3094_small.jpg" alt="Capitol Hill Housing community event" width="500" height="333" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-89 size-large" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/IMG_2499-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-91 size-large" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/Mary-Ruth1-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" /><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-70" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CAPHILLHOUSING-186-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="Ashwin Warrior enters the Capitol Hill Housing offices on 12th Ave." />[/scroller]', 'Capitol Hill Housing Resident Services', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '23-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-07-01 07:48:23', '2018-07-01 07:48:23', '', 23, 'http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/23-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Their mission is to build vibrant and engaged communities through affordable housing and community development. In total, CHH manages approximately 50 properties, each with eligibility requirements ranging from low-income, elderly, disabled, veteran and other eligibility restricted units.\r\n\r\n<img class="wp-image-80 alignnone" style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, \'Segoe UI\', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, \'Helvetica Neue\', sans-serif;" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHH-Logo-1024x326.jpg" alt="Capitol Hill Housing, logo" width="230" height="66" />\r\n<h3>Background</h3>\r\nCapitol Hill Housing’s Resident Service department employs Resident Service Coordinators (RSC) to inform, coordinate and provide resources to its diverse residents.   The RSC primarily communicate with residents through information sheets, advertisements on community boards, door-to-door tactics, community and building events and direct one-on-one contact. They serve as the central resource for all residents living in CHH properties, providing a range of services including general questions, hosting community events and coordinating need-based services such as rental assistance, live-in health care and transportation services to name a few.\r\n<h3>Project Challenges &amp; Goals</h3>\r\nAccording to CHH resident surveys, less than half the residents were aware that CHH provided individualized support through its Resident Services Program. Additionally, the RSC relied heavily of Microsoft word, so it became paramount to create a template system any RSC could use on any type of computer. As such, the project goals were identified as follows:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Inform residents about RSC and increase awareness of the many services available through CHH</li>\r\n 	<li>Simplify the layout and be consistent with the CHH brand</li>\r\n 	<li>Improve the collateral functionality and usability for RSC</li>\r\n 	<li>Improve and increase the visual accessibility for CHH’s diverse residents</li>\r\n 	<li>Improve and increase the trust between resident and RSC in individual communities</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Design Strategy</h3>\r\nTo achieve the stated goals, I set about the process of brainstorming the visual design, assessing technical concerns, researching the methods in which RSC communicate with residents and the reviewing the overall brand image and messaging of CHH. To increase overall brand awareness, I set forth to unify the CHH brand image and develop a template system that could be unique for individual properties, yet consistent with the larger CHH brand. Additionally, I set forth to create pieces that were simply formatted, easily customizable and implementable by the RSC in each residential community.\r\n<h3>Design Solutions</h3>\r\nThe client hired me to provide graphic design services for five collateral items most utilized by the RSC.   The pieces were to be redesigned, while meeting the aforementioned goals in to the five unified, brand consistent templates:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Building Welcome Sheets</li>\r\n 	<li>RSC Persona Sheets</li>\r\n 	<li>Monthly Events Calendar</li>\r\n 	<li>Event Flyers</li>\r\n 	<li>Resource One Sheets</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n[image_block][scroller]<img class="alignnone wp-image-34 size-large" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tmpl_individual-rsc-768x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="853" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-32 size-large" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/poster_resident-services-e1530318746544-834x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="786" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-51 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_welcome-sheetgeneral_8.5x11.jpg" alt="" width="612" height="792" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-52 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_welcome-sheetJoeyG_8.5x11.jpg" alt="" width="612" height="792" />[/scroller]\r\n<h4>Building Welcome and RSC Persona Sheets</h4>\r\nUpon move in, residents receive a packet which includes the building welcome and RSC persona sheets.

For maximum ease of use and flexibility, I designed a variable sidebar layout for things like recurrent event dates and event sign-ups. RSCs can choose between having a single event date or multiple recurring events. Additionally, there is an option for a sign-up content block with a variable height, allowing for maximum customization.   I also created a half-sheet event template that reduces event information to its hook, a primary message and call to action, for use by the RSC as handouts for local, building specific events.\r\n[/image_block]\r\n\r\n[image_block][scroller]<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-36" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tmpl_resource-one-sheet-e1530319531779-819x1024.jpg" alt="" /><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-50" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_resource-one-sheet_8.5x11-791x1024.jpg" alt="" />[/scroller]\r\n<h4>Resource One Sheets</h4>\r\nOne sheets are a template that list all relevant contact information for each resource category.

For maximum ease of use and flexibility, I designed a variable sidebar layout for things like recurrent dates and event sign-ups. RSCs can choose between having a single event date or multiple recurring events, both, or neither.\n\nAdditionally, there is an option for a sign-up content block with a variable height, allowing for maximum customization. I also created a half-sheet event template that reduces event information to its hook, a primary message and call to action, for use by the RSC as handouts for local, building specific events.\n[/image_block]\n\n[image_block][scroller]<img class="alignnone wp-image-50 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_resource-one-sheet_8.5x11.jpg" alt="" width="1700" height="2200" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-36 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tmpl_resource-one-sheet-e1530319531779.jpg" alt="" width="2309" height="2888" />[/scroller]\n<h4>Resource One Sheets</h4>\nThese templates list all relevant contact information for each resource category. I created a typographic system and grid layout that adapts to each collateral template. The system I conceived maintains the appropriate balance between text legibility and readability. This one sheet example is the simplest form of typography and grid layout utilized across every template.\n[/image_block]\n<h3>Design Process</h3>\nThe challenges and client\'s goals were kept at the forefront of my process while designing the collateral. During each step of the project, the following were considered: consistency; accessibility; and usability.\n<h4>Consistency</h4>\nConsistency affects people’s awareness and trust of a brand. If residents aren’t clear what the RSC provide and who they are in relation to CHH, then they are likely to have less faith in the services provided. I directly addressed this issue through a systematically implemented visual design. Through use of typography, white space, graphic elements and color, I achieved overall visual consistency between all collateral templates.\n<h4>Accessibility</h4>\nThe visual design complements the content strategy and does not detract from it. We simplified the text and used language understood by a general audience. I also utilized a relatively large font size to improve legibility and tested the color contrast, to ensure residents with visual impairments could view the content.\n<h4>Usability</h4>\nTo provide maximum ease of use for the RSC, who may not have a background in design or layout programs, I chose Adobe InDesign to make the templates. The Adobe InDesign has excellent interface with Adobe Acrobat, a program used by the majority of CHH employees. This resulted in great ease of use for the RSC, allowing for editable content while maintaining overall brand consistency.\n<h3>Project Results</h3>\nThe overall response from the Client, CHH employees, Resident Service Coordinators and residents was overwhelmingly positive. The visual design and functionality of my project deliverables exceeded their expectations. In fact, after using the new templates, several RSC requested more variations for the event flyers, resulting in additional project work.\n\nWhile redesigning the RSC collateral, I created a visual design inspired by the existing CHH brand. It maintained the familiarity of the old styles, while drastically improving RSC brand accessibility, usability, and consistency. Our focus on content strategy, language and visual harmony allowed the collateral to accommodate the diverse audiences with propriety and appeal.\n\n[scroller]\n<img class="alignnone wp-image-71 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/IMG_3094_small.jpg" alt="Capitol Hill Housing community event" width="500" height="333" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-90 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/IMG_2666.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="1600" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-89 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/IMG_2499.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="1200" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-70 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CAPHILLHOUSING-186-1.jpg" alt="Ashwin Warrior enters the Capitol Hill Housing offices on 12th Ave." width="3000" height="2000" />[/scroller]', 'Capitol Hill Housing Resident Services', 'The Capitol Hill Housing Resident Services department needed brand collateral redesign, in response to many residents indicating they are unaware of Resident Services Coordinators and the resources they provide.', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '23-autosave-v1', '', '', '2018-07-12 18:10:19', '2018-07-12 18:10:19', '', 23, 'http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/23-autosave-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),
(106, 1, '2018-07-02 07:57:51', '2018-07-02 07:57:51', 'Capitol Hill Housing (CHH) is a public corporation organized by the City of Seattle. Their mission is to build vibrant and engaged communities through affordable housing and community development. In total, CHH manages approximately 50 properties, each with eligibility requirements ranging from low-income, elderly, disabled, veteran and other eligibility restricted units.\r\n\r\n<img class="wp-image-80 alignnone" style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, \'Segoe UI\', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, \'Helvetica Neue\', sans-serif;" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHH-Logo-1024x326.jpg" alt="Capitol Hill Housing, logo" width="230" height="66" />\r\n<h3>Background</h3>\r\nCapitol Hill Housing’s Resident Service department employs Resident Service Coordinators (RSC) to inform, coordinate and provide resources to its diverse residents.   The RSC primarily communicate with residents through information sheets, advertisements on community boards, door-to-door tactics, community and building events and direct one-on-one contact. They serve as the central resource for all residents living in CHH properties, providing a range of services including general questions, hosting community events and coordinating need-based services such as rental assistance, live-in health care and transportation services to name a few.\r\n<h3>Project Challenges &amp; Goals</h3>\r\nAccording to CHH resident surveys, less than half the residents were aware that CHH provided individualized support through its Resident Services Program. Additionally, the RSC relied heavily of Microsoft word, so it became paramount to create a template system any RSC could use on any type of computer. As such, the project goals were identified as follows:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Inform residents about RSC and increase awareness of the many services available through CHH</li>\r\n 	<li>Simplify the layout and be consistent with the CHH brand</li>\r\n 	<li>Improve the collateral functionality and usability for RSC</li>\r\n 	<li>Improve and increase the visual accessibility for CHH’s diverse residents</li>\r\n 	<li>Improve and increase the trust between resident and RSC in individual communities</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Design Strategy</h3>\r\nTo achieve the stated goals, I set about the process of brainstorming the visual design, assessing technical concerns, researching the methods in which RSC communicate with residents and the reviewing the overall brand image and messaging of CHH. To increase overall brand awareness, I set forth to unify the CHH brand image and develop a template system that could be unique for individual properties, yet consistent with the larger CHH brand. Additionally, I set forth to create pieces that were simply formatted, easily customizable and implementable by the RSC in each residential community.\r\n<h3>Design Solutions</h3>\r\nThe client hired me to provide graphic design services for five collateral items most utilized by the RSC.   The pieces were to be redesigned, while meeting the aforementioned goals in to the five unified, brand consistent templates:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Building Welcome Sheets</li>\r\n 	<li>RSC Persona Sheets</li>\r\n 	<li>Monthly Events Calendar</li>\r\n 	<li>Event Flyers</li>\r\n 	<li>Resource One Sheets</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n[image_block][scroller]<img class="alignnone wp-image-51 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_welcome-sheetgeneral_8.5x11.jpg" alt="" width="612" height="792" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-52 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_welcome-sheetJoeyG_8.5x11.jpg" alt="" width="612" height="792" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-34 size-large" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tmpl_individual-rsc-768x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="853" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-32 size-large" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/poster_resident-services-e1530318746544-834x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="786" />[/scroller]\r\n<h4>Building Welcome and RSC Persona Sheets</h4>\r\nUpon move in, residents receive a packet which includes the building welcome and RSC persona sheets.

They are available online, by email and posted in community spaces.

It primarily informs residents of the services available to them. We proposed to mount these posters on community boards in public building spaces, around the building property and within CHH offices. This poster design acts as the outward, public facing representation of the CHH Resident Services available.\r\n[/image_block]\r\n<h3>Design Process</h3>\r\nIn developing the collateral pieces, the challenges and goals of the client were kept in the forefront.   As such, in all steps of the project development the following were considered: awareness and consistency; accessibility; and usability.\r\n<h4>Awareness &amp; Consistency</h4>\r\nConsistency affects people’s awareness and trust of a brand.

Their mission is to build vibrant and engaged communities through affordable housing and community development. In total, CHH manages approximately 50 properties, each with eligibility requirements ranging from low-income, elderly, disabled, veteran and other eligibility restricted units.</span>\r\n<h3><b>Background</b></h3>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Capitol Hill Housing Resident Service department employs Resident Service Coordinators (RSC) to inform, coordinate and provide resources to its diverse residents. The RSC primarily communicate with residents through information sheets, advertisements on community boards, door-to-door tactics, community and building events and direct one-on-one contact. They serve as the central resource for all residents living in CHH properties, providing a range of services including general questions, hosting community events and coordinating need-based services such as rental assistance, live-in health care and transportation services to name a few.</span>\r\n<h3><b>Project Challenges &amp; Goals</b></h3>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to CHH resident surveys, less than half the residents were aware that CHH provided individualized support through its Resident Services Program. Additionally, the RSC relied heavily of Microsoft word, so it became paramount to create a template system any RSC could use on any type of computer. As such, the project goals were identified as follows:</span>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inform residents about RSC and increase awareness of the many services available</span></li>\r\n 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simplify the layout and be consistent with the CHH brand</span></li>\r\n 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improve the collateral functionality and usability for RSC</span></li>\r\n 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improve and increase the visual accessibility for CHH’s diverse residents</span></li>\r\n 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improve and increase the trust between resident and RSC in individual communities</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3><b>Design Strategy</b></h3>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">To achieve the stated goals, I set about the process of brainstorming the visual design, assessing technical concerns, researching the methods in which RSC communicate with residents and the reviewing the overall brand image and messaging of CHH. To increase overall brand awareness, I set forth to unify the CHH brand image and develop a template system that could be unique for individual properties, yet consistent with the larger CHH brand. Additionally, I created pieces that were simply formatted, easily customizable and implementable by the RSC in each residential community.</span>\r\n<h3><b>Design Solutions</b></h3>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The client hired me to provide graphic design services for five collateral items most utilized by the RSC. The pieces were to be redesigned, while meeting the aforementioned goals in to the five unified, brand consistent templates:</span>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building Welcome Sheets</span></li>\r\n 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">RSC Persona Sheets</span></li>\r\n 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monthly Events Calendar</span></li>\r\n 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Event Flyers</span></li>\r\n 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resource One Sheets</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">[image_block]</span>\r\n\r\n<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-49" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_Resident-Services-poster_11x17-663x1024.jpg" alt="" />\r\n<h4><b>Resident Services Poster</b></h4>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the five collateral templates, I designed a large format poster to advertise CHH Resident Services. It primarily informs residents of the services available to them. We proposed to mount these posters on community boards in public building spaces, around the building property and within CHH offices. This poster design acts as the outward, public facing representation of the CHH Resident Services available.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">[/image_block]</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">[image_block]</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">[scroller]<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_welcome-sheetgeneral_8.5x11.jpg" alt="" /> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_welcome-sheetJoeyG_8.5x11.jpg" alt="" /> <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-34" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tmpl_individual-rsc-768x1024.jpg" alt="" /> <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-32" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/poster_resident-services-e1530318746544-834x1024.jpg" alt="" />[/scroller]</span>\r\n<h4><b>Building Welcome and RSC Persona Sheets</b></h4>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon move in, residents receive a packet which includes the building welcome and RSC persona sheets. The building welcome sheet informs residents about CHH and resources available through the Resident Services program. The RSC persona sheet introduces the specific RS Coordinator supporting the residents’ property. Both these documents are intended to welcome residents and provide them essential resources, contact information, and other important details about CHH and RSC.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">[/image_block]</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">[image_block]</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">[scroller]<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-53" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE-calendar_11x8.5.jpg" alt="" /> <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-35" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tmpl_residence-calendar-e1530319018147-1024x803.jpg" alt="" />[/scroller]</span>\r\n<h4><b>Monthly Events Calendar</b></h4>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Monthly calendars specific to each property highlight upcoming community events. They are available online, by email and posted in community spaces. After creating a 2018-19 monthly calendar template with updated styles, I added additional content to the footer, specific to each RSC and building property. This allows the RSC to put their contact information and specific building information on the calendars for residents to easily reference.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">[/image_block]</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">[image_block]</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">[scroller]<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_event-poster_8.5x11.jpg" alt="" /> <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-47" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/BLANK_event-flyer_x2_5.5x8.5-1024x791.jpg" alt="" /> <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-33" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tmpl_event-flyers-e1530319332673-797x1024.jpg" alt="" />[/scroller]</span>\r\n<h4><b>Event Flyers</b></h4>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Event flyers are posted in community spaces to advertise a variety of events and workshops. For maximum ease of use and flexibility, I designed a variable sidebar layout for things like recurrent event dates and event sign-ups. RSCs can choose between having a single event date or multiple recurring events. Additionally, there is an option for a sign-up content block with a variable height, allowing for maximum customization.

I created a typographic system and grid layout that adapts to each collateral template. The system I conceived maintains the appropriate balance between text legibility and readability. This one sheet example is the simplest form of typography and grid layout utilized across every template.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">[/image_block]</span>\r\n<h3><b>Design Process</b></h3>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">In developing the collateral pieces, the challenges and goals of the client were kept in the forefront. As such, in all steps of the project development the following were considered: awareness and consistency; accessibility; and usability.</span>\r\n<h4><b>Awareness &amp; Consistency</b></h4>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Consistency affects people’s awareness and trust of a brand. If residents aren’t clear what the RSC provide and who they are in relation to CHH, then they are likely to have less faith in the services provided. I directly addressed this issue through a systematically implemented visual design. Through use of typography, white space, graphic elements and color, I achieved overall visual consistency between each collateral template.</span>\r\n<h4><b>Accessibility</b></h4>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The visual design compliments the content strategy and does not detract from it. We simplified the text and used language understood by a general audience. I also utilized a relatively large font size to improve legibility for residents with visual impairments. Attention was also paid to color usage, to increase accessibility for color visually impaired people.</span>\r\n<h4><b>Usability</b></h4>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">To provide maximum ease of use for the RSC, who may not have a background in design or layout programs, I chose Adobe InDesign to make the templates. The Adobe InDesign has excellent interface with Adobe Acrobat, the program used by the majority of CHH employees. This has resulted in great ease of use for the RSC, allowing for editable content while maintaining overall brand consistency and increased design awareness.</span>\r\n<h3><b>Project Results</b></h3>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The overall response from the Client, CHH employees, Resident Service Coordinators and residents was overwhelming positive. The visual design and functionality of my project deliverables exceeded their expectations. In fact, after using the new templates, several RSC requested more variations for the event flyers, resulting in additional project work. In recreating these design pieces for CHH, I created a visual design similar enough to the existing look to maintain the familiarity of the old styles, while drastically improving brand accessibility, functionality, consistency and awareness. Our focus on content strategy, language and visual harmony allowed the simple style to accommodate the diverse audiences with propriety and appeal.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">[scroller]<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-71" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/IMG_3094_small.jpg" alt="Capitol Hill Housing community event" /> <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-90" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/IMG_2666-768x1024.jpg" alt="" /> <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-89" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/IMG_2499-1024x768.jpg" alt="" /> <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-70" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CAPHILLHOUSING-186-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="Ashwin Warrior enters the Capitol Hill Housing offices on 12th Ave." />[/scroller]</span>', 'Capitol Hill Housing Resident Services', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '23-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-07-07 02:28:32', '2018-07-07 02:28:32', '', 23, 'http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/23-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Their mission is to build vibrant and engaged communities through affordable housing and community development. In total, CHH manages approximately 50 properties, each with eligibility requirements ranging from low-income, elderly, disabled, veteran and other eligibility restricted units.</span>\r\n<h3><b>Background</b></h3>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Capitol Hill Housing Resident Service department employs Resident Service Coordinators (RSC) to inform, coordinate and provide resources to its diverse residents. The RSC primarily communicate with residents through information sheets, advertisements on community boards, door-to-door tactics, community and building events and direct one-on-one contact. They serve as the central resource for all residents living in CHH properties, providing a range of services including general questions, hosting community events and coordinating need-based services such as rental assistance, live-in health care and transportation services to name a few.</span>\r\n<h3><b>Project Challenges &amp; Goals</b></h3>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to CHH resident surveys, less than half the residents were aware that CHH provided individualized support through its Resident Services Program. Additionally, the RSC relied heavily of Microsoft word, so it became paramount to create a template system any RSC could use on any type of computer. As such, the project goals were identified as follows:</span>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inform residents about RSC and increase awareness of the many services available</span></li>\r\n 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simplify the layout and be consistent with the CHH brand</span></li>\r\n 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improve the collateral functionality and usability for RSC</span></li>\r\n 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improve and increase the visual accessibility for CHH’s diverse residents</span></li>\r\n 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improve and increase the trust between resident and RSC in individual communities</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3><b>Design Strategy</b></h3>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">To achieve the stated goals, I set about the process of brainstorming the visual design, assessing technical concerns, researching the methods in which RSC communicate with residents and the reviewing the overall brand image and messaging of CHH. To increase overall brand awareness, I set forth to unify the CHH brand image and develop a template system that could be unique for individual properties, yet consistent with the larger CHH brand. Additionally, I created pieces that were simply formatted, easily customizable and implementable by the RSC in each residential community.</span>\r\n<h3><b>Design Solutions</b></h3>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The client hired me to provide graphic design services for five collateral items most utilized by the RSC.

Their mission is to build vibrant and engaged communities through affordable housing and community development. In total, CHH manages approximately 50 properties, each with eligibility requirements ranging from low-income, elderly, disabled, veteran and other eligibility restricted units.</span>\r\n<h3><b>Background</b></h3>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Capitol Hill Housing Resident Service department employs Resident Service Coordinators (RSC) to inform, coordinate and provide resources to its diverse residents. The RSC primarily communicate with residents through information sheets, advertisements on community boards, door-to-door tactics, community and building events and direct one-on-one contact. They serve as the central resource for all residents living in CHH properties, providing a range of services including general questions, hosting community events and coordinating need-based services such as rental assistance, live-in health care and transportation services to name a few.</span>\r\n<h3><b>Project Challenges &amp; Goals</b></h3>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to CHH resident surveys, less than half the residents were aware that CHH provided individualized support through its Resident Services Program. Additionally, the RSC relied heavily of Microsoft word, so it became paramount to create a template system any RSC could use on any type of computer. As such, the project goals were identified as follows:</span>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inform residents about RSC and increase awareness of the many services available</span></li>\r\n 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simplify the layout and be consistent with the CHH brand</span></li>\r\n 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improve the collateral functionality and usability for RSC</span></li>\r\n 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improve and increase the visual accessibility for CHH’s diverse residents</span></li>\r\n 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improve and increase the trust between resident and RSC in individual communities</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3><b>Design Strategy</b></h3>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">To achieve the stated goals, I set about the process of brainstorming the visual design, assessing technical concerns, researching the methods in which RSC communicate with residents and the reviewing the overall brand image and messaging of CHH. To increase overall brand awareness, I set forth to unify the CHH brand image and develop a template system that could be unique for individual properties, yet consistent with the larger CHH brand. Additionally, I created pieces that were simply formatted, easily customizable and implementable by the RSC in each residential community.</span>\r\n<h3><b>Design Solutions</b></h3>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The client hired me to provide graphic design services for five collateral items most utilized by the RSC. The pieces were to be redesigned, while meeting the aforementioned goals in to the five unified, brand consistent templates:</span>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building Welcome Sheets</span></li>\r\n 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">RSC Persona Sheets</span></li>\r\n 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monthly Events Calendar</span></li>\r\n 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Event Flyers</span></li>\r\n 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resource One Sheets</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">[image_block]\r\n</span><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-49" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_Resident-Services-poster_11x17-663x1024.jpg" alt="" />\r\n<h4><b>Resident Services Poster</b></h4>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the five collateral templates, I designed a large format poster to advertise CHH Resident Services. It primarily informs residents of the services available to them. We proposed to mount these posters on community boards in public building spaces, around the building property and within CHH offices. This poster design acts as the outward, public facing representation of the CHH Resident Services available.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">[/image_block]</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">[image_block]</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">[scroller]<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_welcome-sheetgeneral_8.5x11.jpg" alt="" /> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_welcome-sheetJoeyG_8.5x11.jpg" alt="" /> <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-34" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tmpl_individual-rsc-768x1024.jpg" alt="" /> <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-32" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/poster_resident-services-e1530318746544-834x1024.jpg" alt="" />[/scroller]</span>\r\n<h4><b>Building Welcome and RSC Persona Sheets</b></h4>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon move in, residents receive a packet which includes the building welcome and RSC persona sheets.

(160, 1, '2018-04-30 12:00:49', '2018-04-30 12:00:49', 'For the Capitol Hill Housing leasing department, I conceptualized, designed and developed a leasing packet for an affordable housing development in the Central District called the Liberty Bank Building. The building is a multi-use apartment complex with entirely low-income eligible units and over 2,500 square feet of commercial space for local businesses. It is currently under construction and scheduled to open February 2019.\r\n<h3>Background</h3>The Liberty Bank Building is the result of a collective partnership between Africa Town Central District, Byrd Barr Place, Black Community Impact Alliance, the Capitol Hill Housing Foundation, local community leaders and founders of the Liberty Bank. This historic project aspires to preserve the legacy of <em>the Liberty Bank</em>, "the first Black-owned bank west of the Mississippi, founded as a community response to redlining and disinvestment in Central Seattle" (libertybankbuilding.org).\r\n\r\nHistorically, the City government divested from the Central District. This segregated community became a hub for pan-African and migrant community culture. Today it is experiencing rapid urban development, and as rent increases faster than the existing community members are able to afford, they become displaced from their homes.\r\n\r\nThe Liberty Bank Building is designed to be affordable for everyday people, and continues to support the community for years to come. We wanted to highlight this legacy, preserve the existing identity of the Central District, and steward in a new generation of community engagement.\r\n<h3>Project Challenges &amp; Goals</h3>Existing Liberty Bank material, while resourceful, was lengthy and complex, making it impractical for the target audience. A key assignment for this project was to create leasing content that would be understandable and usable for <em>all members</em> of the community—<em>it needed to be accessible</em>.\r\n\r\nThe leasing packet design was heavily influenced by all these factors. The project goals were:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>to clarify the eligibility requirements for affordable housing</li>\r\n 	<li>walk applicants through the leasing process and timeline for the Liberty Bank Building</li>\r\n 	<li>affirmatively market to audiences affected by rapid urbanization in the Central District</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Design Strategy</h3>The design needed to be tailored to a broad range of audience segments. The primary audience was individuals and families living in the Central District who qualify for affordable housing. The secondary audience was community members and small businesses, particularly of pan-African decent, affected by rapidly rising rent. The third audience, was public officials, agencies, and organization who work in the housing marketplace.\r\n\r\nTo clarify the eligibility requirements for affordable housing and walk applicants through the leasing process, I neatly organized complex leasing information in a format accessible to a broad audience whom are largely unfamiliar with affordable housing regulation in Seattle, but have a deeply rooted history in the Central District.\r\n<h3>Design Solution</h3>[scroller bg-color="LightSlateGrey"]\r\n<img src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018-05-04_LBB-leasing-packet-refinements_spread_1.jpg" class="alignnone wp-image-307 size-full" height="1650" alt="" width="1275"><img src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018-05-04_LBB-leasing-packet-refinements_spread_2.jpg" class="alignnone wp-image-308 size-full" height="1650" alt="" width="2550"><img src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018-05-04_LBB-leasing-packet-refinements_spread_3.jpg" class="alignnone wp-image-309 size-full" height="1650" alt="" width="2550"><img src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018-05-04_LBB-leasing-packet-refinements_spread_4.jpg" class="alignnone wp-image-310 size-full" height="1650" alt="" width="2550"><img src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018-05-04_LBB-leasing-packet-refinements_spread_5.jpg" class="alignnone wp-image-311 size-full" alt="">\r\n[/scroller]\r\n\r\n<!--[column_wrap count="4"]\r\n[column span="1"][fullscreen view="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018-05-04_LBB-leasing-packet-refinements_spread_1.jpg"]Cover[/fullscreen][/column]\r\n[column span="1"][fullscreen view="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018-05-04_LBB-leasing-packet-refinements_spread_2.jpg"]About LBB[/fullscreen][/column]\r\n[column span="1"][fullscreen view="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018-05-04_LBB-leasing-packet-refinements_spread_3.jpg"]Leasing Process[/fullscreen][/column]\r\n[column span="1"][fullscreen view="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018-05-04_LBB-leasing-packet-refinements_spread_4.jpg"]FAQs[/fullscreen][/column]\r\n[/column_wrap]-->\r\n\r\nThe Capitol Hill Housing Foundation hired me to deliver a single leasing packet of the following items:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>General building information including amenities, photos, and location map</li>\r\n 	<li>Affordable housing process overview</li>\r\n 	<li>Income requirements for applying</li>\r\n 	<li>A timeline of the project development and leasing process</li>\r\n 	<li>Frequently Asked Questions sheet</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Design Process</h3>Leasing affordable housing differs from non-subsidized apartments; and the Liberty Bank Building itself poses a unique application process. While focusing on conceptual development with moodboards, typography and color schemes, I worked with the team to categorize, synthesize and tailor content strategically.\r\n\r\nThe visual design is intuitive and simply explains affordable housing, the application process, and eligibility requirements use accessible language. Visual graphs and tables help applicants interactively determine their eligibility, while a four step visual breakdown walks them through the leasing process.\r\n\r\nWe sourced historic photos from the Liberty Bank partners, and composed them with photos of the new Liberty Bank Building. I coordinated with the client to render a more diverse group of people in the building renderings. I was sure to prioritize contact information; and developed a Frequently Asked Questions spread. I also included a timeline of key dates for the project construction and leasing process.\r\n<h3>Project Impact</h3>The layout itself is a huge improvement from the single word document the partners began with. Including photos of the historic Central District and current community events, drastically improved the packet\'s relatability. The use of visual motifs, typographic hierarchy and layout, and brand consistency were driving forces behind achieving project goals.\r\n\r\nThe partners responded very positively to the leasing packet design. The project delivered on schedule and within budget. Once the Liberty Bank Building partners begin actively marketing, it is anticipated this leasing packet will allow local community members to become more familiar with the affordable housing application process and give them the confidence to inquire about living at the Liberty Bank Building.\r\n\r\nThe Liberty Bank Building partners utilized the leasing packet to affirmatively market to audiences affected by rapid urbanization.

This historic project aspires to preserve the legacy of the first black-owned bank west of the Mississippi by continuing to support the community for years to come. We wanted to highlight this legacy, preserve the existing identity of the Central District, and steward in a new generation of community engagement.\r\n<h3>Project Challenges &amp; Goals</h3>\r\nHistorically, the Seattle City government divested from the Central District. This segregated community became a hub for pan African and migrant community culture. Today it is experiencing rapid urban development. As rent increases faster than the existing community members are able to afford, they become displaced from their homes. The Liberty Bank Bank building will provide affordable housing for these very residents, in a continued effort to preserve the Central District’s cultural identity.\r\n\r\nCapitol Hill Housing provided me a single microsoft word document with all existing information about the leasing process for the Liberty Bank Building. It contained complex language, had a lengthy format, and was largely inaccessible to individuals most in need of this very information. Consequently the inaccessibility of this information led to rumors being spread about the project development and its leasing process.\r\n\r\nThe leasing packet design was heavily influenced by all these factors. The scoped project goals were:\r\nto clarify the eligibility requirements for affordable housing,\r\nwalk applicants through the leasing process and timeline for the Liberty Bank Building,\r\nand affirmatively market to audiences affected by rapid urbanization in the Central District.\r\n<h3>Design Strategy</h3>\r\nA major variable for the The Liberty Bank Building leasing packet is the differing audience segments I needed to tailor the design to. The primary audience is individuals and families living in the Central District who qualify for affordable housing and those looking for information on the leasing process and how to apply for the Liberty Bank Building. The secondary audience is community members and small businesses, particularly of pan-African decent, affected by displacement in the Central District; or those individuals and community partners at risk of being unable to afford rapid rent increases in the housing and commercial real estate market.\r\n\r\nIn order to clarify the eligibility requirements for affordable housing and walk applicants through the leasing process, I neatly organized complex leasing information in a format accessible to a broad audience whom are largely unfamiliar with affordable housing regulation in Seattle.\r\n\r\nThe Liberty Bank Building partners will utilize the leasing packet to affirmatively market to audiences affected by rapid urbanization by hosting local community events in which these leasing packets will be distributed to local residents. We intend partnered staff to be present, answering questions on site. The visual design compliments their marketing tactics in a way that communicates the history of the Liberty Bank, expresses the future tone of the Liberty Bank Building, and un-offensively appreciates and respects the pan-african community in the Central District.\r\n<h3>Design Solution</h3>\r\n[scroller] LBB Leasing Packet Slideshow [/scroller]\r\n\r\nThe Capitol Hill Housing Foundation hired me to deliver a single leasing packet of the following items:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>General building information like amenities, photos, and location map</li>\r\n 	<li>Affordable housing process overview</li>\r\n 	<li>Income requirements for applying</li>\r\n 	<li>A timeline of the project development and leasing</li>\r\n 	<li>Frequently Asked Questions</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Design Process</h3>\r\nLeasing affordable housing differs from non-subsidized apartments; and the Liberty Bank Building itself poses a unique application process. While focusing on conceptual development with moodboards, typography and color schemes, I worked with the partners team to effortlessly to categorize, synthesize and tailored content strategically.\r\n\r\nThe visual design is intuitive and simply explains affordable housing, the application process, and eligibility requirements using accessible language. Visual graphs and tables help applicants interactively determine their eligibility, while a four step visual breakdown walks them through the leasing process. We sourced historic photos from the Liberty Bank partners, and composed them with photos of the new Liberty Bank Building. We even coordinated with the architect to render a more diverse group of people in the building renderings. I was sure to prioritize contact information; and in case anyone has additional questions, a subsequent spread contains Frequently Ask Questions. I also included a handy timeline of key dates for the project construction and leasing process.\r\n<h3>Project Impact</h3>\r\nThe layout itself is a huge improvement from the single word document the partners began with. Including photos of the historic Central District and current community events, drastically improved the packets relatability to our target audience. The use of visual motifs, typographic hierarchy and layout, and brand consistency were driving forces behind achieving project goals.\r\n\r\nThe Capitol Hill Housing Association ensures their approach to each community building is both intentional and affective in targeting individuals in need of affordable housing. Upon beginning this assignment, there were minor tensions rising between community partners as its construction progressed. The success of this collateral project strengthened the Liberty Bank Building partners’ trust in Capitol Hill Housings’ ability to be aware of its context and deliver content that is relevant to this project’s audience.\r\n\r\nThe a vast majority of the partners responded very positively to the leasing packet design, with only minor tweaks to the cover needed after the fact. Overall the project delivered on schedule and within the partners budget. Once the Liberty Bank Building partners begin actively marketing, it is anticipated this leasing packet will allow local community members to become more familiar with the affordable housing application process and give them the confidence to inquire about living at the Liberty Bank Building.\r\n<h3>Sources</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><a href="http://libertybankbuilding.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Liberty Bank Building</a></li>\r\n 	<li><a href="http://www.africatownlandtrust.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Africa Town Land Trust, Central District</a></li>\r\n 	<li><a href="https://byrdbarrplace.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Byrd Barr Place</a></li>\r\n 	<li><a href="http://david-harris-wkj7.squarespace.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black Community Impact Alliance</a></li>\r\n 	<li><a href="https://www.capitolhillhousing.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Capitol Hill Housing Foundation</a></li>\r\n</ul>', 'The Liberty Bank Building', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '160-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-07-07 02:57:30', '2018-07-07 02:57:30', '', 160, 'http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/160-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),
(168, 1, '2018-07-07 03:07:37', '2018-07-07 03:07:37', 'Capitol Hill Housing (CHH) is a public corporation organized by the City of Seattle. Their mission is to build vibrant and engaged communities through affordable housing and community development. In total, CHH manages approximately 50 properties, each with eligibility requirements ranging from low-income, elderly, disabled, veteran and other eligibility restricted units.\r\n<h3>Background</h3>\r\nCapitol Hill Housing Resident Service department employs Resident Service Coordinators (RSC) to inform, coordinate and provide resources to its diverse residents. The RSC primarily communicate with residents through information sheets, advertisements on community boards, door-to-door tactics, community and building events and direct one-on-one contact. They serve as the central resource for all residents living in CHH properties, providing a range of services including general questions, hosting community events and coordinating need-based services such as rental assistance, live-in health care and transportation services to name a few.\r\n<h3>Project Challenges &amp; Goals</h3>\r\nAccording to CHH resident surveys, less than half the residents were aware that CHH provided individualized support through its Resident Services Program. Additionally, the RSC relied heavily of Microsoft word, so it became paramount to create a template system any RSC could use on any type of computer. As such, the project goals were identified as follows:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Inform residents about RSC and increase awareness of the many services available</li>\r\n 	<li>Simplify the layout and be consistent with the CHH brand</li>\r\n 	<li>Improve the collateral functionality and usability for RSC</li>\r\n 	<li>Improve and increase the visual accessibility for CHH’s diverse residents</li>\r\n 	<li>Improve and increase the trust between resident and RSC in individual communities</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Design Strategy</h3>\r\nTo achieve the stated goals, I set about the process of brainstorming the visual design, assessing technical concerns, researching the methods in which RSC communicate with residents and the reviewing the overall brand image and messaging of CHH. To increase overall brand awareness, I set forth to unify the CHH brand image and develop a template system that could be unique for individual properties, yet consistent with the larger CHH brand. Additionally, I created pieces that were simply formatted, easily customizable and implementable by the RSC in each residential community.\r\n<h3>Design Solutions</h3>\r\nThe client hired me to provide graphic design services for five collateral items most utilized by the RSC. The pieces were to be redesigned, while meeting the aforementioned goals in to the five unified, brand consistent templates:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Building Welcome Sheets</li>\r\n 	<li>RSC Persona Sheets</li>\r\n 	<li>Monthly Events Calendar</li>\r\n 	<li>Event Flyers</li>\r\n 	<li>Resource One Sheets</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n[image_block]<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-49" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_Resident-Services-poster_11x17-663x1024.jpg" alt="" />\r\n<h4>Resident Services Poster</h4>\r\nIn addition to the five collateral templates, I designed a large format poster to advertise CHH Resident Services. It primarily informs residents of the services available to them. We proposed to mount these posters on community boards in public building spaces, around the building property and within CHH offices. This poster design acts as the outward, public facing representation of the CHH Resident Services available.\r\n[/image_block]\r\n\r\n[image_block][scroller]<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_welcome-sheetgeneral_8.5x11.jpg" alt="" /><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_welcome-sheetJoeyG_8.5x11.jpg" alt="" /><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-34" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tmpl_individual-rsc-768x1024.jpg" alt="" /><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-32" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/poster_resident-services-e1530318746544-834x1024.jpg" alt="" />[/scroller]\r\n<h4>Building Welcome and RSC Persona Sheets</h4>\r\nUpon move in, residents receive a packet which includes the building welcome and RSC persona sheets. The building welcome sheet informs residents about CHH and resources available through the Resident Services program. The RSC persona sheet introduces the specific RS Coordinator supporting the residents’ property. Both these documents are intended to welcome residents and provide them essential resources, contact information, and other important details about CHH and RSC.[/image_block]\r\n\r\n[image_block][scroller]<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-53" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE-calendar_11x8.5.jpg" alt="" /> <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-35" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tmpl_residence-calendar-e1530319018147-1024x803.jpg" alt="" />[/scroller]\r\n<h4>Monthly Events Calendar</h4>\r\nMonthly calendars specific to each property highlight upcoming community events. They are available online, by email and posted in community spaces. After creating a 2018-19 monthly calendar template with updated styles, I added additional content to the footer, specific to each RSC and building property. This allows the RSC to put their contact information and specific building information on the calendars for residents to easily reference.\r\n[/image_block]\r\n\r\n[image_block][scroller]<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_event-poster_8.5x11.jpg" alt="" /> <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-47" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/BLANK_event-flyer_x2_5.5x8.5-1024x791.jpg" alt="" /> <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-33" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tmpl_event-flyers-e1530319332673-797x1024.jpg" alt="" />[/scroller]\r\n<h4>Event Flyers</h4>\r\nEvent flyers are posted in community spaces to advertise a variety of events and workshops. For maximum ease of use and flexibility, I designed a variable sidebar layout for things like recurrent event dates and event sign-ups. RSCs can choose between having a single event date or multiple recurring events. Additionally, there is an option for a sign-up content block with a variable height, allowing for maximum customization. I also created a half-sheet event template that reduces event information to its hook, a primary message and call to action, for use by the RSC as handouts for local, building specific events.\r\n[/image_block]\r\n\r\n[image_block][scroller]<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-50" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_resource-one-sheet_8.5x11-791x1024.jpg" alt="" /> <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-36" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tmpl_resource-one-sheet-e1530319531779-819x1024.jpg" alt="" />[/scroller]\r\n<h4>Resource One Sheets</h4>\r\nOne sheets are a template that list all relevant contact information for each resource category. I created a typographic system and grid layout that adapts to each collateral template. The system I conceived maintains the appropriate balance between text legibility and readability. This one sheet example is the simplest form of typography and grid layout utilized across every template.\r\n[/image_block]\r\n\r\n<h3>Design Process</h3>\r\nIn developing the collateral pieces, the challenges and goals of the client were kept in the forefront. As such, in all steps of the project development the following were considered: awareness and consistency; accessibility; and usability.\r\n\r\n<h4>Awareness &amp; Consistency</h4>\r\nConsistency affects people’s awareness and trust of a brand. If residents aren’t clear what the RSC provide and who they are in relation to CHH, then they are likely to have less faith in the services provided. I directly addressed this issue through a systematically implemented visual design. Through use of typography, white space, graphic elements and color, I achieved overall visual consistency between each collateral template.\r\n\r\n<h4>Accessibility</h4>\r\nThe visual design compliments the content strategy and does not detract from it. We simplified the text and used language understood by a general audience. I also utilized a relatively large font size to improve legibility for residents with visual impairments. Attention was also paid to color usage, to increase accessibility for color visually impaired people.\r\n\r\n<h4>Usability</h4>\r\nTo provide maximum ease of use for the RSC, who may not have a background in design or layout programs, I chose Adobe InDesign to make the templates. The Adobe InDesign has excellent interface with Adobe Acrobat, the program used by the majority of CHH employees. This has resulted in great ease of use for the RSC, allowing for editable content while maintaining overall brand consistency and increased design awareness.\r\n\r\n<h3>Project Results</h3>\r\nThe overall response from the Client, CHH employees, Resident Service Coordinators and residents was overwhelming positive. The visual design and functionality of my project deliverables exceeded their expectations. In fact, after using the new templates, several RSC requested more variations for the event flyers, resulting in additional project work. In recreating these design pieces for CHH, I created a visual design similar enough to the existing look to maintain the familiarity of the old styles, while drastically improving brand accessibility, functionality, consistency and awareness. Our focus on content strategy, language and visual harmony allowed the simple style to accommodate the diverse audiences with propriety and appeal.\r\n\r\n[scroller]<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-71" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/IMG_3094_small.jpg" alt="Capitol Hill Housing community event" /> <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-90" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/IMG_2666-768x1024.jpg" alt="" /> <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-89" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/IMG_2499-1024x768.jpg" alt="" /> <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-70" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CAPHILLHOUSING-186-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="Ashwin Warrior enters the Capitol Hill Housing offices on 12th Ave." />[/scroller]', 'Capitol Hill Housing Resident Services', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '23-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-07-07 03:07:37', '2018-07-07 03:07:37', '', 23, 'http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/23-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

The building is a multi-use apartment complex with entirely low-income eligible units and over 2,500 square feet of commercial space for local businesses. It is currently under construction and set to open in February 2019.\r\n<h3>Background</h3>\r\nThe Liberty Bank Building is the result of a collective partnership between Africa Town Central District, Byrd Barr Place, Black Community Impact Alliance, the Capitol HIll Housing Foundation, local community leaders and founders of the Liberty Bank. This historic project aspires to preserve the legacy of the first black-owned bank west of the Mississippi by continuing to support the community for years to come. We wanted to highlight this legacy, preserve the existing identity of the Central District, and steward in a new generation of community engagement.\r\n<h3>Project Challenges &amp; Goals</h3>\r\nHistorically, the Seattle City government divested from the Central District. This segregated community became a hub for pan African and migrant community culture. Today it is experiencing rapid urban development. As rent increases faster than the existing community members are able to afford, they become displaced from their homes. The Liberty Bank Bank building will provide affordable housing for these very residents, in a continued effort to preserve the Central District’s cultural identity.\r\n\r\nCapitol Hill Housing provided me a single microsoft word document with all existing information about the leasing process for the Liberty Bank Building. It contained complex language, had a lengthy format, and was largely inaccessible to individuals most in need of this very information. Consequently the inaccessibility of this information led to rumors being spread about the project development and its leasing process.\r\n\r\nThe leasing packet design was heavily influenced by all these factors. The scoped project goals were:\r\nto clarify the eligibility requirements for affordable housing,\r\nwalk applicants through the leasing process and timeline for the Liberty Bank Building,\r\nand affirmatively market to audiences affected by rapid urbanization in the Central District.\r\n<h3>Design Strategy</h3>\r\nA major variable for the The Liberty Bank Building leasing packet is the differing audience segments I needed to tailor the design to. The primary audience is individuals and families living in the Central District who qualify for affordable housing and those looking for information on the leasing process and how to apply for the Liberty Bank Building. The secondary audience is community members and small businesses, particularly of pan-African decent, affected by displacement in the Central District; or those individuals and community partners at risk of being unable to afford rapid rent increases in the housing and commercial real estate market.\r\n\r\nIn order to clarify the eligibility requirements for affordable housing and walk applicants through the leasing process, I neatly organized complex leasing information in a format accessible to a broad audience whom are largely unfamiliar with affordable housing regulation in Seattle.\r\n\r\nThe Liberty Bank Building partners will utilize the leasing packet to affirmatively market to audiences affected by rapid urbanization by hosting local community events in which these leasing packets will be distributed to local residents. We intend partnered staff to be present, answering questions on site. The visual design compliments their marketing tactics in a way that communicates the history of the Liberty Bank, expresses the future tone of the Liberty Bank Building, and un-offensively appreciates and respects the pan-african community in the Central District.\r\n<h3>Design Solution</h3>\r\n\r\n[scroller bg-color="LightSlateGrey"]<img src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018-05-04_LBB-leasing-packet-cover-refinements_compressed_Page_1.jpg" alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-175" /> <img src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018-05-04_LBB-leasing-packet-cover-refinements_compressed_Page_2.jpg" alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-176" /> <img src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018-05-04_LBB-leasing-packet-cover-refinements_compressed_Page_3.jpg" alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-177" /> <img src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018-05-04_LBB-leasing-packet-cover-refinements_compressed_Page_4.jpg" alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-178" /> <img src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018-05-04_LBB-leasing-packet-cover-refinements_compressed_Page_5.jpg" alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-179" />[/scroller]\r\n\r\nThe Capitol Hill Housing Foundation hired me to deliver a single leasing packet of the following items:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>General building information like amenities, photos, and location map</li>\r\n 	<li>Affordable housing process overview</li>\r\n 	<li>Income requirements for applying</li>\r\n 	<li>A timeline of the project development and leasing</li>\r\n 	<li>Frequently Asked Questions</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Design Process</h3>\r\nLeasing affordable housing differs from non-subsidized apartments; and the Liberty Bank Building itself poses a unique application process.

When executing the final deliverables, Kenzie created the typographic pattern and packaging design, while I focused on the large format menu board, small take-out menu, and brand identity style guide.\r\n\r\n[image_block][scroller]<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-185" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CMB_style-guide_8.5x11.jpg" alt="" /><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-188" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CMB-menu_6x11.jpg" alt="" /><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-187" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CMB_menu-board_6x4ft_opt-2.jpg" alt="" />[/scroller]\r\n<h4>Brand style guide</h4>\r\n<h4>6x11 in. takeout menu</h4>\r\n<h4>6x4 ft. menu board</h4>\r\n[/image_block]\r\n\r\n<h3>Design Process</h3>\r\nWhile brainstorming and exploring concepts, Kenzie and I provided the client with numerous concepts, each of which approached the CMB brand from a unique lense. Upon listening more closely to general feedback from others and the client’s reaction to our presentation, they liked the variety of font selections we provided, but overall they gravitated towards more simpler fonts and cleaner illustrations. We decided on a typographic solution that used a simple typographic logo mark and a typographic pattern as the primary brand elements with a gooey yellow accent color.\r\n\r\n<h3>Project Impact</h3>\r\nWe successfully delivered the brand identity packet to the client on schedule and within our budget. Afterwards, I maintained a positive relationship with the client and both design colleagues. CMB is open today and thriving in Seattle’s International District at the Uwajimaya Village market place.\r\n<h3>Sources</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><a href="https://cheesemeatsbread.life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cheese Meats Bread</a></li>\r\n 	<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chriselvis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Client Relations: Chris Mercurio</a></li>\r\n 	<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kenzie-nicholson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Designer: Kenzie Nicholson</a></li>\r\n</ul>', 'Cheese Meats Bread', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '183-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-07-07 04:10:13', '2018-07-07 04:10:13', '', 183, 'http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/183-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

(217, 1, '2016-03-10 12:00:42', '2016-03-10 12:00:42', '<h3>Background</h3>\r\nFor a service learning assignment, I formed a design team with several colleagues and we partnered with the Capitol Hill Arts District (CHAD) to design an awareness campaign that coincided with their new website.\r\n<h3>Project Challenges &amp; Goals</h3>\r\nAccording to a neighborhood survey, many residents were unaware that CHAD existed. It was the first neighborhood to be named as part of the Arts &amp; Cultural Districts program by the Seattle City Government in 2014. CHAD launched their website in 2017 to elevate its presence.\r\n\r\nMy team’s primary goal was to build off the visual tone established on their website and to increase community awareness. Another key challenge for this assignment was to manage, plan, and coordinate a collaborative design with a team. As the Design Lead, I worked closely with the team to delegate and deliver a comprehensive collateral design and marketing plan to our client.\r\n<h3>Design Strategy</h3>\r\nOur team developed a targeted marketing campaign, focusing on the environmental and neighborhood aspects of CHAD. By designing the collateral materials as elements of a wayfinding system and complimenting pre-existing brand elements, we increased pedestrian and drivers’ perception of CHAD’s physical boundary.\r\n\r\nInside of the CHAD, we empowered community partners to facilitate the neighborhood brand. We distributed small format postcards and stickers to community partners and asked them to display and sell them within their business. Digital assets, like neighborhood photographs and Facebook cover photos, expanded the CHAD presence online. Additionally, the hashtags #NowEntering and #CapitolHillArtsDistrict were applied to the collateral to track the conversation online.\r\n<h3>Design Solution</h3>\r\nThe Capitol Hill Arts District requested that we deliver each of the following:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>11x17 in. poster design</li>\r\n 	<li>6x4 in. postcard design</li>\r\n 	<li>4x4 in. round sticker</li>\r\n 	<li>Facebook cover photo</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n[scroller bg-color="white"]\r\n<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-224" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_poster-mockup-side-by-side.jpg" alt="" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-225 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_poster-telephone-pole-01.jpg" alt="" /><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-226" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_poster-telephone-pole-02.jpg" alt="" />[/scroller]\r\n\r\n<img class="alignnone wp-image-220 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/Capitol-Hill-Arts-District-social-media-mockup.jpg" alt="" />\r\n<h3>Design Process</h3>\r\nAs the Team Lead, it was my responsibility to understand the scope of work, coordinate a schedule between the designers and our client, delegate tasks to each team member, and maintain a positive focus on the project goals and deliverables.\r\n\r\nThe design process included reviewing existing collateral and advertisements, and brainstorming ways to expand upon the existing wayfinding signage. Utilizing over 50 photos of public artworks and murals within the Arts district, our team developed initial concepts, developed content and produced a series of layouts.\r\n\r\nThe project scope also included researching of local printers and advertisement companies, coordinating and securing price estimates for printing and posting flyers around Capitol Hill.\r\n<h3>Project Impact</h3>\r\nOur team presented the campaign to the Arts District Steering Committee and recommended a course of action for marketing CHAD. The committee response was overwhelmingly positive.\r\n\r\nThey appreciated the versatility of the design system we made. The text content was minimal and remained consistent across the collateral. The CHAD logo was prominently featured, while the interchangeable background photos of CHAD murals highlighted the local community. The interchangeable backgrounds empowered the committee to swap out photographs with other options—sourcing background photos from district partners and community members delivered more community value. This unique, adaptable design approach proved very successful to the client.\r\n\r\nThe marketing collateral served as advertisements and aided wayfinding. The large format posters were put along the perimeter of the district to identify its boundary, while personal collateral items were used inside partner locations. The collateral did a solid job notifying people they were entering a new city neighborhood and complemented existing CHAD brand signage. The content was focused and clearly promoted shared art and cultural values, which improved people’s awareness and perception of CHAD.\r\n\r\nTo our excitement, many businesses endorsed our efforts to market the CHAD. They liked having the responsibility as a community partner to facilitate the neighborhood’s brand. Some community partners even opted to put the poster advertisement in their window.\r\n\r\nThe committee accepted our proposed marketing plan and the posters, stickers, and postcards were successfully promoted in the Capitol Hill Arts District throughout the summer of 2017.\r\n<h3>Sources</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><a href="http://capitolhillarts.org/now-entering/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Capitol Hill Arts, Now Entering campaign page</a></li>\r\n 	<li><a href="https://segd.org/what-wayfinding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">What is Wayfinding? — Seattle Environmental Graphic Design</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[column_wrap count="2"]\r\n\r\n[column]\r\n<img class="alignnone wp-image-223 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_postcards-front-01.jpg" alt="" />\r\n[/column]\r\n\r\n[column]\r\n\r\n<img class="alignnone wp-image-222 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_postcards-back.jpg" alt="" width="2812" height="2824" />\r\n\r\n[/column]\r\n\r\n[/column_wrap]\r\n\r\n[column_wrap count="9"]\r\n[column]\r\n<img class="alignnone wp-image-234 size-thumbnail" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-dark-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />\r\n[/column][column]\r\n<img class="alignnone wp-image-227 size-thumbnail" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-1-red-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="135" height="135" />\r\n[/column][column]\r\n<img class="alignnone wp-image-228 size-thumbnail" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-2-orange-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="135" height="135" />\r\n[/column][column]\r\n<img class="alignnone wp-image-229 size-thumbnail" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-3-yellow-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="135" height="135" />\r\n[/column][column]\r\n<img class="alignnone wp-image-230 size-thumbnail" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-4-green-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="135" height="135" />\r\n[/column][column]\r\n<img class="alignnone wp-image-231 size-thumbnail" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-5-teal-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />\r\n[/column][column]\r\n<img class="alignnone wp-image-232 size-thumbnail" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-6-blue-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="135" height="135" />\r\n[/column][column]\r\n<img class="alignnone wp-image-233 size-thumbnail" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-7-purple-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="135" height="135" />\r\n[/column][column]\r\n<img class="alignnone wp-image-235 size-thumbnail" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-light-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="135" height="135" />\r\n[/column]\r\n[/column_wrap]', 'Capitol Hill Arts District', 'As Design Team Lead, some colleagues and I partnered with the Capitol Hill Arts District to design an awareness campaign that coincided with their new website.', 'publish', 'closed', 'open', '', 'capitol-hill-arts-district', '', '\nhttp://capitolhillarts.org/now-entering/', '2018-07-25 19:40:45', '2018-07-25 19:40:45', '', 0, 'http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/?p=217', 0, 'post', '', 0),
(218, 1, '2018-07-07 05:11:42', '2018-07-07 05:11:42', 'For a service learning assignment, I formed a design team with design colleagues, Alicia Smith and Ivy Ye. We partnered with the Capitol Hill Arts District (CH Arts District) to design an awareness campaign to coincide with their new website launch.\r\n<h3>Project Challenges &amp; Goals</h3>\r\nAccording to a recent neighborhood serve, many residents are unaware that Capitol Hill was the first district to be named as part of the Arts &amp; Cultural Districts program by the Seattle City Government (2014). After a couple years of partnering and community building, CH Arts District launched their new website in 2017 to elevate its presence. This print marketing campaign built off the visual tone established on their website and the primary goal was to increase local community’s awareness of the CH Arts District.\r\n\r\nA key challenge for this design assignment was to manage, plan, and coordinate a collaborative design with a team. As the Design Team Lead, I worked closely with Alicia and Ivy to delegate and deliver to our client a comprehensive collateral design and marketing plan.\r\n<h3>Design Strategy</h3>\r\nOur team collaboratively wrote and developed an original marketing campaign. We focused on the environmental and neighborhood aspect of the CH Arts District by designing the marketing collateral as elements of a wayfinding system (link) to compliment pre-existing brand elements. For example, they recently installed new road signs on the CH Arts District perimeter that now include the logo. This improved drivers’ awareness of the Arts District brand and geographic location. We wanted to capitalize on their approach to expand the wayfinding signage for pedestrians and increase people’s perception of the CH Arts District physical boundary.\r\n\r\nInside of the CH Arts District, we empowered community partners to facilitate the neighborhood brand. We distributed small format postcards and stickers to community partners and asked them to display and or sell them within their business.\r\n\r\nDigital assets, like neighborhood photographs and Facebook cover photos, expanded the CH Arts District presence online. Additionally, the hashtags #NowEntering and #CapitolHillArtsDistrict were applied to the collateral to track the conversation online.\r\n<h3>Design Solution</h3>\r\nThe Capitol Hill Arts District requested that we deliver to them each the following:\r\n\r\n11x17 in. poster design\r\n\r\n6x4 in. postcard design\r\n\r\n4x4 in. round sticker\r\n\r\nFacebook cover photo\r\n<h3>Design Process</h3>\r\nAs the Design Team Lead, it was my responsibility to understand the scope of work to be done, coordinate a schedule between the designers and our client, delegate tasks to each team member, and maintain a positive focus on the project goals and deliverables.\r\n\r\nFirst, we got together and brainstormed the idea to use the collateral advertisements to expand the CH Arts District wayfinding signage. One weekend, I spent the day walking around Capitol Hill and captured over 50 photos of public artworks and murals within the Arts District perimeter. Then, our team regrouped and critiqued initial sketches and define our concept more.\r\n\r\nWith the community photographs to use as the background content for the postcard and poster, Alicia and I produced a series of poster layouts; while Ivy designed the stickers. Alicia went ahead and made the postcard layout. I used the photographs to create social media cover photos. Once again, we regrouped and critiqued our team concept, before further refining the details and presenting to the client.\r\n\r\nAfter the final designs were selected by the client, I thoroughly researched local printers and advertisement companies in Capitol Hill to coordinate getting price estimates, printing the collateral, and posting the flyers. I then put everything together into a single presentation the give to the Arts District Steering Committee.\r\n<h3>Project Impact</h3>\r\nIn March 2017, our team presented the campaign to the Arts District Steering Committee during one of their weekly meetings and recommended a course of action for marketing the CH Arts District.\r\n\r\nThe committee response was overwhelmingly positive. They appreciate the versatility of the design system we made. The text content was minimal and remained consistent across the collateral. The CH Arts District logo was prominently feature like they requested, while the interchangeable background photos of CH Arts District murals highlighted the local community.\r\n\r\nThis design system delivered more value because, since the background content is interchangeable, it empowered the committee to swap out photographs with other options we provided, or even to source background photos from district partners and community members. This was a unique approach to the steering committee and they appreciated the adaptability we provided them.\r\n\r\nThe marketing collateral served as advertisements and aided wayfinding. The large format posters were put along the perimeter of the district to identify its boundary, while small collateral items were used inside partner buildings to allow them to associate with the Arts District. The collateral did a solid job notifying people they were entering a new city neighborhood and complemented existing CH Arts District brand signage. The content was focused and clearly promoted shared art and cultural values, which improved people\'s awareness and perception of the CH Arts District.\r\n\r\nOne issue was, the advertisements were posting these on street poles and our design had to compete with local musicians and community event posters. We combated this issue by reducing the text content to its primary elements and adding ample emphasis to the header. The variety of background photos, taken from the local community, gave the poster design a sense of familiarity because much of the featured artwork was iconic for the Capitol Hill Arts District Community.\r\n\r\nIn combination with branded stickers and postcards, we anticipated that residents would interact with CH Arts District collateral as they enter the neighborhood perimeter, then within community partner locations, and begin to associate the partner location with the CH Arts District.\r\n\r\nTo our excitement, many businesses endorsed our efforts to market the CH Arts District. They liked having the responsibility as a community partners to facilitate the neighborhood’s brand and promote community art engagement. Some community partners even opted to put the poster advertisement in their window, too. After all the CH Arts District would not exist if it were not for the nearly 50 neighborhood partners who make up the Capitol Hill Arts District.\r\n\r\nThe committee accepted our proposed marketing plan and the posters, stickers, and postcards were successfully promoted in the Capitol Hill Arts District throughout the summer of 2017.\r\n<h3>Sources</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><a href="http://capitolhillarts.org/now-entering/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Capitol Hill Arts, Now Entering campaign</a></li>\r\n 	<li><a style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, \'Segoe UI\', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, \'Helvetica Neue\', sans-serif;" href="https://segd.org/what-wayfinding" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Seattle Environmental Graphic Design: What is Wayfinding?</a></li>\r\n</ul>', 'Capitol Hill Arts District', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '217-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-07-07 05:11:42', '2018-07-07 05:11:42', '', 217, 'http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/217-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0) ;

Additionally, the hashtags #NowEntering and #CapitolHillArtsDistrict were applied to the collateral to track the conversation online.\nDesign Solution\nThe Capitol Hill Arts District requested that we deliver each of the following:\n11x17 in. poster design\n6x4 in. postcard design\n4x4 in. round sticker\nFacebook cover photo\n\n[scroller bg-color="white"]\n<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-224" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_poster-mockup-side-by-side.jpg" alt="" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-225 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_poster-telephone-pole-01.jpg" alt="" /><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-226" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_poster-telephone-pole-02.jpg" alt="" />[/scroller]\n\n<img class="alignnone wp-image-220 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/Capitol-Hill-Arts-District-social-media-mockup.jpg" alt="" />\n\nDesign Process\nAs the Team Lead, it was my responsibility to understand the scope of work, coordinate a schedule between the designers and our client, delegate tasks to each team member, and maintain a positive focus on the project goals and deliverables.\nThe design process included reviewing existing collateral and advertisements, and brainstorming ways to expand upon the existing wayfinding signage. Utilizing over 50 photos of public artworks and murals within the Arts district, our team developed initial concepts, developed content and produced a series of layouts.\nThe project scope also included researching of local printers and advertisement companies, coordinating and securing price estimates for printing and posting flyers around Capitol Hill.\nProject Impact\nOur team presented the campaign to the Arts District Steering Committee and recommended a course of action for marketing CHAD. The committee response was overwhelmingly positive.\nThey appreciated the versatility of the design system we made. The text content was minimal and remained consistent across the collateral. The CHAD logo was prominently featured, while the interchangeable background photos of CHAD murals highlighted the local community. The interchangeable backgrounds empowered the committee to swap out photographs with other options—sourcing background photos from district partners and community members delivered more community value. This unique, adaptable design approach proved very successful to the client.\nThe marketing collateral served as advertisements and aided wayfinding. The large format posters were put along the perimeter of the district to identify its boundary, while personal collateral items were used inside partner locations. The collateral did a solid job notifying people they were entering a new city neighborhood and complemented existing CHAD brand signage. The content was focused and clearly promoted shared art and cultural values, which improved people’s awareness and perception of CHAD.\nTo our excitement, many businesses endorsed our efforts to market the CHAD. They liked having the responsibility as a community partner to facilitate the neighborhood’s brand. Some community partners even opted to put the poster advertisement in their window.\nThe committee accepted our proposed marketing plan and the posters, stickers, and postcards were successfully promoted in the Capitol Hill Arts District throughout the summer of 2017.\n<h3>Sources</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li><a href="http://capitolhillarts.org/now-entering/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Capitol Hill Arts, Now Entering campaign page</a></li>\n 	<li><a href="https://segd.org/what-wayfinding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">What is Wayfinding? — Seattle Environmental Graphic Design</a></li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[column_wrap count="2"]\n\n[column]\n<img class="alignnone wp-image-223 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_postcards-front-01.jpg" alt="" />\n[/column]\n\n[column]\n\n<img class="alignnone wp-image-222 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_postcards-back.jpg" alt="" width="2812" height="2824" />\n\n[/column]\n\n[/column_wrap]\n\n[column_wrap count="9"]\n[column]\n<img class="alignnone wp-image-234 size-thumbnail" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-dark-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />\n[/column][column]\n<img class="alignnone wp-image-227 size-thumbnail" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-1-red-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="135" height="135" />\n[/column][column]\n<img class="alignnone wp-image-228 size-thumbnail" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-2-orange-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="135" height="135" />\n[/column][column]\n<img class="alignnone wp-image-229 size-thumbnail" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-3-yellow-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="135" height="135" />\n[/column][column]\n<img class="alignnone wp-image-230 size-thumbnail" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-4-green-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="135" height="135" />\n[/column][column]\n<img class="alignnone wp-image-231 size-thumbnail" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-5-teal-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />\n[/column][column]\n<img class="alignnone wp-image-232 size-thumbnail" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-6-blue-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="135" height="135" />\n[/column][column]\n<img class="alignnone wp-image-233 size-thumbnail" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-7-purple-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="135" height="135" />\n[/column][column]\n<img class="alignnone wp-image-235 size-thumbnail" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-light-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="135" height="135" />\n[/column]\n[/column_wrap]', 'Capitol Hill Arts District', 'As Design Team Lead, some colleagues and I partnered with the Capitol Hill Arts District to design an awareness campaign that coincided with their new website.', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '217-autosave-v1', '', '', '2018-07-11 19:30:17', '2018-07-11 19:30:17', '', 217, 'http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/217-autosave-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

We partnered with the Capitol Hill Arts District (CH Arts District) to design an awareness campaign to coincide with their new website launch.\r\n<h3>Project Challenges &amp; Goals</h3>\r\nAccording to a recent neighborhood serve, many residents are unaware that Capitol Hill was the first district to be named as part of the Arts &amp; Cultural Districts program by the Seattle City Government (2014). After a couple years of partnering and community building, CH Arts District launched their new website in 2017 to elevate its presence. This print marketing campaign built off the visual tone established on their website and the primary goal was to increase local community’s awareness of the CH Arts District.\r\n\r\nA key challenge for this design assignment was to manage, plan, and coordinate a collaborative design with a team. As the Design Team Lead, I worked closely with Alicia and Ivy to delegate and deliver to our client a comprehensive collateral design and marketing plan.\r\n<h3>Design Strategy</h3>\r\nOur team collaboratively wrote and developed an original marketing campaign. We focused on the environmental and neighborhood aspect of the CH Arts District by designing the marketing collateral as elements of a wayfinding system (link) to compliment pre-existing brand elements. For example, they recently installed new road signs on the CH Arts District perimeter that now include the logo. This improved drivers’ awareness of the Arts District brand and geographic location. We wanted to capitalize on their approach to expand the wayfinding signage for pedestrians and increase people’s perception of the CH Arts District physical boundary.\r\n\r\nInside of the CH Arts District, we empowered community partners to facilitate the neighborhood brand. We distributed small format postcards and stickers to community partners and asked them to display and or sell them within their business.\r\n\r\nDigital assets, like neighborhood photographs and Facebook cover photos, expanded the CH Arts District presence online. Additionally, the hashtags #NowEntering and #CapitolHillArtsDistrict were applied to the collateral to track the conversation online.\r\n<h3>Design Solution</h3>\r\nThe Capitol Hill Arts District requested that we deliver to them each the following:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>11x17 in. poster design</li>\r\n 	<li>6x4 in. postcard design</li>\r\n 	<li>4x4 in. round sticker</li>\r\n 	<li>Facebook cover photo</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n[scroller]<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-224" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_poster-mockup-side-by-side.jpg" alt="" /><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-225" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_poster-telephone-pole-01.jpg" alt="" /><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-226" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_poster-telephone-pole-02.jpg" alt="" />[/scroller]\r\n\r\n[scroller]<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-223" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_postcards-front-01.jpg" alt="" /><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-222" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_postcards-back.jpg" alt="" />[/scroller]\r\n\r\n[scroller]<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-220" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/Capitol-Hill-Arts-District-social-media-mockup.jpg" alt="" /><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-221" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_Facebook-cover-photo_820x340_01.jpg" alt="" />[/scroller]\r\n<h3>Design Process</h3>\r\nAs the Design Team Lead, it was my responsibility to understand the scope of work to be done, coordinate a schedule between the designers and our client, delegate tasks to each team member, and maintain a positive focus on the project goals and deliverables.\r\n\r\nFirst, we got together and brainstormed the idea to use the collateral advertisements to expand the CH Arts District wayfinding signage. One weekend, I spent the day walking around Capitol Hill and captured over 50 photos of public artworks and murals within the Arts District perimeter. Then, our team regrouped and critiqued initial sketches and define our concept more.\r\n\r\nWith the community photographs to use as the background content for the postcard and poster, Alicia and I produced a series of poster layouts; while Ivy designed the stickers. Alicia went ahead and made the postcard layout. I used the photographs to create social media cover photos. Once again, we regrouped and critiqued our team concept, before further refining the details and presenting to the client.\r\n\r\nAfter the final designs were selected by the client, I thoroughly researched local printers and advertisement companies in Capitol Hill to coordinate getting price estimates, printing the collateral, and posting the flyers. I then put everything together into a single presentation the give to the Arts District Steering Committee.\r\n<h3>Project Impact</h3>\r\nIn March 2017, our team presented the campaign to the Arts District Steering Committee during one of their weekly meetings and recommended a course of action for marketing the CH Arts District.\r\n\r\nThe committee response was overwhelmingly positive. They appreciate the versatility of the design system we made. The text content was minimal and remained consistent across the collateral. The CH Arts District logo was prominently feature like they requested, while the interchangeable background photos of CH Arts District murals highlighted the local community.\r\n\r\nThis design system delivered more value because, since the background content is interchangeable, it empowered the committee to swap out photographs with other options we provided, or even to source background photos from district partners and community members. This was a unique approach to the steering committee and they appreciated the adaptability we provided them.\r\n\r\nThe marketing collateral served as advertisements and aided wayfinding. The large format posters were put along the perimeter of the district to identify its boundary, while small collateral items were used inside partner buildings to allow them to associate with the Arts District. The collateral did a solid job notifying people they were entering a new city neighborhood and complemented existing CH Arts District brand signage. The content was focused and clearly promoted shared art and cultural values, which improved people\'s awareness and perception of the CH Arts District.\r\n\r\nOne issue was, the advertisements were posting these on street poles and our design had to compete with local musicians and community event posters. We combated this issue by reducing the text content to its primary elements and adding ample emphasis to the header. The variety of background photos, taken from the local community, gave the poster design a sense of familiarity because much of the featured artwork was iconic for the Capitol Hill Arts District Community.\r\n\r\nIn combination with branded stickers and postcards, we anticipated that residents would interact with CH Arts District collateral as they enter the neighborhood perimeter, then within community partner locations, and begin to associate the partner location with the CH Arts District.\r\n\r\nTo our excitement, many businesses endorsed our efforts to market the CH Arts District. They liked having the responsibility as a community partners to facilitate the neighborhood’s brand and promote community art engagement. Some community partners even opted to put the poster advertisement in their window, too. After all the CH Arts District would not exist if it were not for the nearly 50 neighborhood partners who make up the Capitol Hill Arts District.\r\n\r\nThe committee accepted our proposed marketing plan and the posters, stickers, and postcards were successfully promoted in the Capitol Hill Arts District throughout the summer of 2017.\r\n<h3>Sources</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><a href="http://capitolhillarts.org/now-entering/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Capitol Hill Arts, Now Entering campaign</a></li>\r\n 	<li><a style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, \'Segoe UI\', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, \'Helvetica Neue\', sans-serif;" href="https://segd.org/what-wayfinding" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Seattle Environmental Graphic Design: What is Wayfinding?</a></li>\r\n</ul>', 'Capitol Hill Arts District', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '217-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-07-07 05:18:39', '2018-07-07 05:18:39', '', 217, 'http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/217-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

One weekend, I spent the day walking around Capitol Hill and captured over 50 photos of public artworks and murals within the Arts District perimeter. Then, our team regrouped and critiqued initial sketches and define our concept more.\r\n\r\nWith the community photographs to use as the background content for the postcard and poster, Alicia and I produced a series of poster layouts; while Ivy designed the stickers.

I then put everything together into a single presentation the give to the Arts District Steering Committee.\r\n<h3>Project Impact</h3>\r\nIn March 2017, our team presented the campaign to the Arts District Steering Committee during one of their weekly meetings and recommended a course of action for marketing the CH Arts District.\r\n\r\nThe committee response was overwhelmingly positive. They appreciate the versatility of the design system we made. The text content was minimal and remained consistent across the collateral. The CH Arts District logo was prominently feature like they requested, while the interchangeable background photos of CH Arts District murals highlighted the local community.\r\n\r\nThis design system delivered more value because, since the background content is interchangeable, it empowered the committee to swap out photographs with other options we provided, or even to source background photos from district partners and community members. This was a unique approach to the steering committee and they appreciated the adaptability we provided them.\r\n\r\nThe marketing collateral served as advertisements and aided wayfinding. The large format posters were put along the perimeter of the district to identify its boundary, while small collateral items were used inside partner buildings to allow them to associate with the Arts District. The collateral did a solid job notifying people they were entering a new city neighborhood and complemented existing CH Arts District brand signage. The content was focused and clearly promoted shared art and cultural values, which improved people\'s awareness and perception of the CH Arts District.\r\n\r\nOne issue was, the advertisements were posting these on street poles and our design had to compete with local musicians and community event posters. We combated this issue by reducing the text content to its primary elements and adding ample emphasis to the header. The variety of background photos, taken from the local community, gave the poster design a sense of familiarity because much of the featured artwork was iconic for the Capitol Hill Arts District Community.\r\n\r\nIn combination with branded stickers and postcards, we anticipated that residents would interact with CH Arts District collateral as they enter the neighborhood perimeter, then within community partner locations, and begin to associate the partner location with the CH Arts District.\r\n\r\nTo our excitement, many businesses endorsed our efforts to market the CH Arts District. They liked having the responsibility as a community partners to facilitate the neighborhood’s brand and promote community art engagement. Some community partners even opted to put the poster advertisement in their window, too. After all the CH Arts District would not exist if it were not for the nearly 50 neighborhood partners who make up the Capitol Hill Arts District.\r\n\r\nThe committee accepted our proposed marketing plan and the posters, stickers, and postcards were successfully promoted in the Capitol Hill Arts District throughout the summer of 2017.\r\n\r\n<h3>Sources</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><a href="http://capitolhillarts.org/now-entering/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Capitol Hill Arts, Now Entering campaign</a></li>\r\n 	<li><a style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, \'Segoe UI\', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, \'Helvetica Neue\', sans-serif;" href="https://segd.org/what-wayfinding" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Seattle Environmental Graphic Design: What is Wayfinding?</a></li>\r\n</ul>', 'Capitol Hill Arts District', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '217-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-07-07 05:20:04', '2018-07-07 05:20:04', '', 217, 'http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/217-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

We partnered with the Capitol Hill Arts District (CH Arts District) to design an awareness campaign to coincide with their new website launch.\r\n<h3>Project Challenges &amp; Goals</h3>\r\nAccording to a recent neighborhood serve, many residents are unaware that Capitol Hill was the first district to be named as part of the Arts &amp; Cultural Districts program by the Seattle City Government (2014). After a couple years of partnering and community building, CH Arts District launched their new website in 2017 to elevate its presence. This print marketing campaign built off the visual tone established on their website and the primary goal was to increase local community’s awareness of the CH Arts District.\r\n\r\nA key challenge for this design assignment was to manage, plan, and coordinate a collaborative design with a team. As the Design Team Lead, I worked closely with Alicia and Ivy to delegate and deliver to our client a comprehensive collateral design and marketing plan.\r\n<h3>Design Strategy</h3>\r\nOur team collaboratively wrote and developed an original marketing campaign. We focused on the environmental and neighborhood aspect of the CH Arts District by designing the marketing collateral as elements of a wayfinding system (link) to compliment pre-existing brand elements. For example, they recently installed new road signs on the CH Arts District perimeter that now include the logo. This improved drivers’ awareness of the Arts District brand and geographic location. We wanted to capitalize on their approach to expand the wayfinding signage for pedestrians and increase people’s perception of the CH Arts District physical boundary.\r\n\r\nInside of the CH Arts District, we empowered community partners to facilitate the neighborhood brand. We distributed small format postcards and stickers to community partners and asked them to display and or sell them within their business.\r\n\r\nDigital assets, like neighborhood photographs and Facebook cover photos, expanded the CH Arts District presence online. Additionally, the hashtags #NowEntering and #CapitolHillArtsDistrict were applied to the collateral to track the conversation online.\r\n<h3>Design Solution</h3>\r\nThe Capitol Hill Arts District requested that we deliver to them each the following:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>11x17 in. poster design</li>\r\n 	<li>6x4 in. postcard design</li>\r\n 	<li>4x4 in. round sticker</li>\r\n 	<li>Facebook cover photo</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n[scroller bg-color="white"]\r\n<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-224" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_poster-mockup-side-by-side.jpg" alt="" /><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-225" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_poster-telephone-pole-01.jpg" alt="" /><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-226" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_poster-telephone-pole-02.jpg" alt="" />[/scroller]\r\n\r\n[column_wrap count="2"][column]\r\n<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-223" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_postcards-front-01.jpg" alt="" />\r\n[/column][column]\r\n<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-222" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_postcards-back.jpg" alt="" />\r\n[/column][/column_wrap]\r\n\r\n<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-220" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/Capitol-Hill-Arts-District-social-media-mockup.jpg" alt="" />\r\n<h3>Design Process</h3>\r\nAs the Design Team Lead, it was my responsibility to understand the scope of work to be done, coordinate a schedule between the designers and our client, delegate tasks to each team member, and maintain a positive focus on the project goals and deliverables.\r\n\r\nFirst, we got together and brainstormed the idea to use the collateral advertisements to expand the CH Arts District wayfinding signage. One weekend, I spent the day walking around Capitol Hill and captured over 50 photos of public artworks and murals within the Arts District perimeter. Then, our team regrouped and critiqued initial sketches and define our concept more.\r\n\r\nWith the community photographs to use as the background content for the postcard and poster, Alicia and I produced a series of poster layouts; while Ivy designed the stickers. Alicia went ahead and made the postcard layout. I used the photographs to create social media cover photos. Once again, we regrouped and critiqued our team concept, before further refining the details and presenting to the client.\r\n\r\nAfter the final designs were selected by the client, I thoroughly researched local printers and advertisement companies in Capitol Hill to coordinate getting price estimates, printing the collateral, and posting the flyers. I then put everything together into a single presentation the give to the Arts District Steering Committee.\r\n<h3>Project Impact</h3>\r\nIn March 2017, our team presented the campaign to the Arts District Steering Committee during one of their weekly meetings and recommended a course of action for marketing the CH Arts District.\r\n\r\nThe committee response was overwhelmingly positive. They appreciate the versatility of the design system we made. The text content was minimal and remained consistent across the collateral. The CH Arts District logo was prominently feature like they requested, while the interchangeable background photos of CH Arts District murals highlighted the local community.\r\n\r\nThis design system delivered more value because, since the background content is interchangeable, it empowered the committee to swap out photographs with other options we provided, or even to source background photos from district partners and community members. This was a unique approach to the steering committee and they appreciated the adaptability we provided them.\r\n\r\nThe marketing collateral served as advertisements and aided wayfinding. The large format posters were put along the perimeter of the district to identify its boundary, while small collateral items were used inside partner buildings to allow them to associate with the Arts District. The collateral did a solid job notifying people they were entering a new city neighborhood and complemented existing CH Arts District brand signage. The content was focused and clearly promoted shared art and cultural values, which improved people\'s awareness and perception of the CH Arts District.\r\n\r\nOne issue was, the advertisements were posting these on street poles and our design had to compete with local musicians and community event posters. We combated this issue by reducing the text content to its primary elements and adding ample emphasis to the header. The variety of background photos, taken from the local community, gave the poster design a sense of familiarity because much of the featured artwork was iconic for the Capitol Hill Arts District Community.\r\n\r\nIn combination with branded stickers and postcards, we anticipated that residents would interact with CH Arts District collateral as they enter the neighborhood perimeter, then within community partner locations, and begin to associate the partner location with the CH Arts District.\r\n\r\nTo our excitement, many businesses endorsed our efforts to market the CH Arts District. They liked having the responsibility as a community partners to facilitate the neighborhood’s brand and promote community art engagement. Some community partners even opted to put the poster advertisement in their window, too. After all the CH Arts District would not exist if it were not for the nearly 50 neighborhood partners who make up the Capitol Hill Arts District.\r\n\r\nThe committee accepted our proposed marketing plan and the posters, stickers, and postcards were successfully promoted in the Capitol Hill Arts District throughout the summer of 2017.\r\n<h3>Sources</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><a href="http://capitolhillarts.org/now-entering/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Capitol Hill Arts, Now Entering campaign</a></li>\r\n 	<li><a style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, \'Segoe UI\', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, \'Helvetica Neue\', sans-serif;" href="https://segd.org/what-wayfinding" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Seattle Environmental Graphic Design: What is Wayfinding?</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-234 alignleft" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-dark-150x150.jpg" alt="" /><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-227 alignleft" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-1-red-150x150.jpg" alt="" />\r\n<img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-228 alignleft" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-2-orange-150x150.jpg" alt="" /><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-229 alignleft" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-3-yellow-150x150.jpg" alt="" /><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-230 alignleft" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-4-green-150x150.jpg" alt="" /><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-231 alignleft" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-5-teal-150x150.jpg" alt="" /><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-232 alignleft" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-6-blue-150x150.jpg" alt="" /><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-233 alignleft" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-7-purple-150x150.jpg" alt="" />\r\n<img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-235 alignleft" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-light-150x150.jpg" alt="" />', 'Capitol Hill Arts District', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '217-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-07-07 05:26:41', '2018-07-07 05:26:41', '', 217, 'http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/217-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

One weekend, I spent the day walking around Capitol Hill and captured over 50 photos of public artworks and murals within the Arts District perimeter. Then, our team regrouped and critiqued initial sketches and define our concept more.\r\n\r\nWith the community photographs to use as the background content for the postcard and poster, Alicia and I produced a series of poster layouts; while Ivy designed the stickers. Alicia went ahead and made the postcard layout. I used the photographs to create social media cover photos. Once again, we regrouped and critiqued our team concept, before further refining the details and presenting to the client.\r\n\r\nAfter the final designs were selected by the client, I thoroughly researched local printers and advertisement companies in Capitol Hill to coordinate getting price estimates, printing the collateral, and posting the flyers. I then put everything together into a single presentation the give to the Arts District Steering Committee.\r\n<h3>Project Impact</h3>\r\nIn March 2017, our team presented the campaign to the Arts District Steering Committee during one of their weekly meetings and recommended a course of action for marketing the CH Arts District.\r\n\r\nThe committee response was overwhelmingly positive. They appreciate the versatility of the design system we made. The text content was minimal and remained consistent across the collateral. The CH Arts District logo was prominently feature like they requested, while the interchangeable background photos of CH Arts District murals highlighted the local community.\r\n\r\nThis design system delivered more value because, since the background content is interchangeable, it empowered the committee to swap out photographs with other options we provided, or even to source background photos from district partners and community members. This was a unique approach to the steering committee and they appreciated the adaptability we provided them.\r\n\r\nThe marketing collateral served as advertisements and aided wayfinding. The large format posters were put along the perimeter of the district to identify its boundary, while small collateral items were used inside partner buildings to allow them to associate with the Arts District. The collateral did a solid job notifying people they were entering a new city neighborhood and complemented existing CH Arts District brand signage. The content was focused and clearly promoted shared art and cultural values, which improved people\'s awareness and perception of the CH Arts District.\r\n\r\nOne issue was, the advertisements were posting these on street poles and our design had to compete with local musicians and community event posters. We combated this issue by reducing the text content to its primary elements and adding ample emphasis to the header. The variety of background photos, taken from the local community, gave the poster design a sense of familiarity because much of the featured artwork was iconic for the Capitol Hill Arts District Community.\r\n\r\nIn combination with branded stickers and postcards, we anticipated that residents would interact with CH Arts District collateral as they enter the neighborhood perimeter, then within community partner locations, and begin to associate the partner location with the CH Arts District.\r\n\r\nTo our excitement, many businesses endorsed our efforts to market the CH Arts District. They liked having the responsibility as a community partners to facilitate the neighborhood’s brand and promote community art engagement. Some community partners even opted to put the poster advertisement in their window, too. After all the CH Arts District would not exist if it were not for the nearly 50 neighborhood partners who make up the Capitol Hill Arts District.\r\n\r\nThe committee accepted our proposed marketing plan and the posters, stickers, and postcards were successfully promoted in the Capitol Hill Arts District throughout the summer of 2017.\r\n<h3>Sources</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><a href="http://capitolhillarts.org/now-entering/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Capitol Hill Arts, Now Entering campaign</a></li>\r\n 	<li><a style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, \'Segoe UI\', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, \'Helvetica Neue\', sans-serif;" href="https://segd.org/what-wayfinding" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Seattle Environmental Graphic Design: What is Wayfinding?</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n[column_wrap count="9"]\r\n<img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-234 alignleft" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-dark-150x150.jpg" alt="" />\r\n<img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-227 alignleft" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-1-red-150x150.jpg" alt="" />\r\n<img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-228 alignleft" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-2-orange-150x150.jpg" alt="" />\r\n<img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-229 alignleft" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-3-yellow-150x150.jpg" alt="" />\r\n<img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-230 alignleft" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-4-green-150x150.jpg" alt="" />\r\n<img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-231 alignleft" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-5-teal-150x150.jpg" alt="" />\r\n<img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-232 alignleft" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-6-blue-150x150.jpg" alt="" />\r\n<img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-233 alignleft" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-7-purple-150x150.jpg" alt="" />\r\n<img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-235 alignleft" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-light-150x150.jpg" alt="" />\r\n[/column_wrap]', 'Capitol Hill Arts District', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '217-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-07-07 05:28:53', '2018-07-07 05:28:53', '', 217, 'http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/217-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

We partnered with the Capitol Hill Arts District (CH Arts District) to design an awareness campaign to coincide with their new website launch.\r\n<h3>Project Challenges &amp; Goals</h3>\r\nAccording to a recent neighborhood serve, many residents are unaware that Capitol Hill was the first district to be named as part of the Arts &amp; Cultural Districts program by the Seattle City Government (2014). After a couple years of partnering and community building, CH Arts District launched their new website in 2017 to elevate its presence. This print marketing campaign built off the visual tone established on their website and the primary goal was to increase local community’s awareness of the CH Arts District.\r\n\r\nA key challenge for this design assignment was to manage, plan, and coordinate a collaborative design with a team. As the Design Team Lead, I worked closely with Alicia and Ivy to delegate and deliver to our client a comprehensive collateral design and marketing plan.\r\n<h3>Design Strategy</h3>\r\nOur team collaboratively wrote and developed an original marketing campaign. We focused on the environmental and neighborhood aspect of the CH Arts District by designing the marketing collateral as elements of a wayfinding system (link) to compliment pre-existing brand elements. For example, they recently installed new road signs on the CH Arts District perimeter that now include the logo. This improved drivers’ awareness of the Arts District brand and geographic location. We wanted to capitalize on their approach to expand the wayfinding signage for pedestrians and increase people’s perception of the CH Arts District physical boundary.\r\n\r\nInside of the CH Arts District, we empowered community partners to facilitate the neighborhood brand.

We partnered with the Capitol Hill Arts District (CH Arts District) to design an awareness campaign to coincide with their new website launch.\r\n<h3>Project Challenges &amp; Goals</h3>\r\nAccording to a recent neighborhood serve, many residents are unaware that Capitol Hill was the first district to be named as part of the Arts &amp; Cultural Districts program by the Seattle City Government (2014). After a couple years of partnering and community building, CH Arts District launched their new website in 2017 to elevate its presence. This print marketing campaign built off the visual tone established on their website and the primary goal was to increase local community’s awareness of the CH Arts District.\r\n\r\nA key challenge for this design assignment was to manage, plan, and coordinate a collaborative design with a team. As the Design Team Lead, I worked closely with Alicia and Ivy to delegate and deliver to our client a comprehensive collateral design and marketing plan.\r\n<h3>Design Strategy</h3>\r\nOur team collaboratively wrote and developed an original marketing campaign. We focused on the environmental and neighborhood aspect of the CH Arts District by designing the marketing collateral as elements of a wayfinding system (link) to compliment pre-existing brand elements. For example, they recently installed new road signs on the CH Arts District perimeter that now include the logo. This improved drivers’ awareness of the Arts District brand and geographic location. We wanted to capitalize on their approach to expand the wayfinding signage for pedestrians and increase people’s perception of the CH Arts District physical boundary.\r\n\r\nInside of the CH Arts District, we empowered community partners to facilitate the neighborhood brand. We distributed small format postcards and stickers to community partners and asked them to display and or sell them within their business.\r\n\r\nDigital assets, like neighborhood photographs and Facebook cover photos, expanded the CH Arts District presence online. Additionally, the hashtags #NowEntering and #CapitolHillArtsDistrict were applied to the collateral to track the conversation online.\r\n<h3>Design Solution</h3>\r\nThe Capitol Hill Arts District requested that we deliver to them each the following:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>11x17 in. poster design</li>\r\n 	<li>6x4 in. postcard design</li>\r\n 	<li>4x4 in. round sticker</li>\r\n 	<li>Facebook cover photo</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n[scroller bg-color="white"]<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-224" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_poster-mockup-side-by-side.jpg" alt="" /><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-225" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_poster-telephone-pole-01.jpg" alt="" /><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-226" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_poster-telephone-pole-02.jpg" alt="" />[/scroller]\r\n\r\n<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-220" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/Capitol-Hill-Arts-District-social-media-mockup.jpg" alt="" />\r\n\r\n<h3>Design Process</h3>\r\nAs the Design Team Lead, it was my responsibility to understand the scope of work to be done, coordinate a schedule between the designers and our client, delegate tasks to each team member, and maintain a positive focus on the project goals and deliverables.\r\n\r\nFirst, we got together and brainstormed the idea to use the collateral advertisements to expand the CH Arts District wayfinding signage. One weekend, I spent the day walking around Capitol Hill and captured over 50 photos of public artworks and murals within the Arts District perimeter. Then, our team regrouped and critiqued initial sketches and define our concept more.\r\n\r\nWith the community photographs to use as the background content for the postcard and poster, Alicia and I produced a series of poster layouts; while Ivy designed the stickers. Alicia went ahead and made the postcard layout. I used the photographs to create social media cover photos. Once again, we regrouped and critiqued our team concept, before further refining the details and presenting to the client.\r\n\r\nAfter the final designs were selected by the client, I thoroughly researched local printers and advertisement companies in Capitol Hill to coordinate getting price estimates, printing the collateral, and posting the flyers. I then put everything together into a single presentation the give to the Arts District Steering Committee.\r\n<h3>Project Impact</h3>\r\nIn March 2017, our team presented the campaign to the Arts District Steering Committee during one of their weekly meetings and recommended a course of action for marketing the CH Arts District.\r\n\r\nThe committee response was overwhelmingly positive. They appreciate the versatility of the design system we made. The text content was minimal and remained consistent across the collateral. The CH Arts District logo was prominently feature like they requested, while the interchangeable background photos of CH Arts District murals highlighted the local community.\r\n\r\nThis design system delivered more value because, since the background content is interchangeable, it empowered the committee to swap out photographs with other options we provided, or even to source background photos from district partners and community members. This was a unique approach to the steering committee and they appreciated the adaptability we provided them.\r\n\r\nThe marketing collateral served as advertisements and aided wayfinding. The large format posters were put along the perimeter of the district to identify its boundary, while small collateral items were used inside partner buildings to allow them to associate with the Arts District. The collateral did a solid job notifying people they were entering a new city neighborhood and complemented existing CH Arts District brand signage. The content was focused and clearly promoted shared art and cultural values, which improved people\'s awareness and perception of the CH Arts District.\r\n\r\nOne issue was, the advertisements were posting these on street poles and our design had to compete with local musicians and community event posters. We combated this issue by reducing the text content to its primary elements and adding ample emphasis to the header. The variety of background photos, taken from the local community, gave the poster design a sense of familiarity because much of the featured artwork was iconic for the Capitol Hill Arts District Community.\r\n\r\nIn combination with branded stickers and postcards, we anticipated that residents would interact with CH Arts District collateral as they enter the neighborhood perimeter, then within community partner locations, and begin to associate the partner location with the CH Arts District.\r\n\r\nTo our excitement, many businesses endorsed our efforts to market the CH Arts District. They liked having the responsibility as a community partners to facilitate the neighborhood’s brand and promote community art engagement. Some community partners even opted to put the poster advertisement in their window, too.

Additionally, the hashtags #NowEntering and #CapitolHillArtsDistrict were applied to the collateral to track the conversation online.\r\n<h3>Design Solution</h3>\r\nThe Capitol Hill Arts District requested that we deliver to them each the following:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>11x17 in. poster design</li>\r\n 	<li>6x4 in. postcard design</li>\r\n 	<li>4x4 in. round sticker</li>\r\n 	<li>Facebook cover photo</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n[scroller bg-color="white"]<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-224" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_poster-mockup-side-by-side.jpg" alt="" /><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-225" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_poster-telephone-pole-01.jpg" alt="" /><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-226" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_poster-telephone-pole-02.jpg" alt="" />[/scroller]\r\n\r\n<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-220" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/Capitol-Hill-Arts-District-social-media-mockup.jpg" alt="" />\r\n<h3>Design Process</h3>\r\nAs the Design Team Lead, it was my responsibility to understand the scope of work to be done, coordinate a schedule between the designers and our client, delegate tasks to each team member, and maintain a positive focus on the project goals and deliverables.\r\n\r\nFirst, we got together and brainstormed the idea to use the collateral advertisements to expand the CH Arts District wayfinding signage. One weekend, I spent the day walking around Capitol Hill and captured over 50 photos of public artworks and murals within the Arts District perimeter. Then, our team regrouped and critiqued initial sketches and define our concept more.\r\n\r\nWith the community photographs to use as the background content for the postcard and poster, Alicia and I produced a series of poster layouts; while Ivy designed the stickers. Alicia went ahead and made the postcard layout. I used the photographs to create social media cover photos. Once again, we regrouped and critiqued our team concept, before further refining the details and presenting to the client.\r\n\r\nAfter the final designs were selected by the client, I thoroughly researched local printers and advertisement companies in Capitol Hill to coordinate getting price estimates, printing the collateral, and posting the flyers. I then put everything together into a single presentation the give to the Arts District Steering Committee.\r\n<h3>Project Impact</h3>\r\nIn March 2017, our team presented the campaign to the Arts District Steering Committee during one of their weekly meetings and recommended a course of action for marketing the CH Arts District.\r\n\r\nThe committee response was overwhelmingly positive. They appreciate the versatility of the design system we made. The text content was minimal and remained consistent across the collateral. The CH Arts District logo was prominently feature like they requested, while the interchangeable background photos of CH Arts District murals highlighted the local community.\r\n\r\nThis design system delivered more value because, since the background content is interchangeable, it empowered the committee to swap out photographs with other options we provided, or even to source background photos from district partners and community members. This was a unique approach to the steering committee and they appreciated the adaptability we provided them.\r\n\r\nThe marketing collateral served as advertisements and aided wayfinding. The large format posters were put along the perimeter of the district to identify its boundary, while small collateral items were used inside partner buildings to allow them to associate with the Arts District. The collateral did a solid job notifying people they were entering a new city neighborhood and complemented existing CH Arts District brand signage. The content was focused and clearly promoted shared art and cultural values, which improved people\'s awareness and perception of the CH Arts District.\r\n\r\nOne issue was, the advertisements were posting these on street poles and our design had to compete with local musicians and community event posters. We combated this issue by reducing the text content to its primary elements and adding ample emphasis to the header. The variety of background photos, taken from the local community, gave the poster design a sense of familiarity because much of the featured artwork was iconic for the Capitol Hill Arts District Community.\r\n\r\nIn combination with branded stickers and postcards, we anticipated that residents would interact with CH Arts District collateral as they enter the neighborhood perimeter, then within community partner locations, and begin to associate the partner location with the CH Arts District.\r\n\r\nTo our excitement, many businesses endorsed our efforts to market the CH Arts District. They liked having the responsibility as a community partners to facilitate the neighborhood’s brand and promote community art engagement. Some community partners even opted to put the poster advertisement in their window, too. After all the CH Arts District would not exist if it were not for the nearly 50 neighborhood partners who make up the Capitol Hill Arts District.\r\n\r\nThe committee accepted our proposed marketing plan and the posters, stickers, and postcards were successfully promoted in the Capitol Hill Arts District throughout the summer of 2017.\r\n<h3>Sources</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><a href="http://capitolhillarts.org/now-entering/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Capitol Hill Arts, Now Entering campaign</a></li>\r\n 	<li><a href="https://segd.org/what-wayfinding" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Seattle Environmental Graphic Design: What is Wayfinding?</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n[column_wrap count="2"][column]\r\n<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-223" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_postcards-front-01.jpg" alt="" />\r\n[/column][column]\r\n<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-222" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_postcards-back.jpg" alt="" />\r\n[/column][/column_wrap]\r\n\r\n[column_wrap count="9"]\r\n[column]\r\n<img class="alignnone wp-image-234 size-thumbnail" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-dark-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />\r\n[/column][column]\r\n<img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-227 alignnone" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-1-red-150x150.jpg" alt="" />\r\n[/column][column]\r\n<img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-228 alignnone" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-2-orange-150x150.jpg" alt="" />\r\n[/column][column]\r\n<img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-229 alignnone" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-3-yellow-150x150.jpg" alt="" />\r\n[/column][column]\r\n<img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-230 alignnone" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-4-green-150x150.jpg" alt="" />\r\n[/column][column]\r\n<img class="alignnone wp-image-231 size-thumbnail" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-5-teal-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />\r\n[/column][column]\r\n<img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-232 alignnone" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-6-blue-150x150.jpg" alt="" />\r\n[/column][column]\r\n<img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-233 alignnone" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-7-purple-150x150.jpg" alt="" />\r\n[/column][column]\r\n<img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-235 alignnone" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-light-150x150.jpg" alt="" />\r\n[/column]\r\n[/column_wrap]', 'Capitol Hill Arts District', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '217-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-07-07 05:32:54', '2018-07-07 05:32:54', '', 217, 'http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/217-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0) ;

We partnered with the Capitol Hill Arts District (CH Arts District) to design an awareness campaign to coincide with their new website launch.\r\n<h3>Project Challenges &amp; Goals</h3>\r\nAccording to a recent neighborhood serve, many residents are unaware that Capitol Hill was the first district to be named as part of the Arts &amp; Cultural Districts program by the Seattle City Government (2014). After a couple years of partnering and community building, CH Arts District launched their new website in 2017 to elevate its presence. This print marketing campaign built off the visual tone established on their website and the primary goal was to increase local community’s awareness of the CH Arts District.\r\n\r\nA key challenge for this design assignment was to manage, plan, and coordinate a collaborative design with a team. As the Design Team Lead, I worked closely with Alicia and Ivy to delegate and deliver to our client a comprehensive collateral design and marketing plan.\r\n<h3>Design Strategy</h3>\r\nOur team collaboratively wrote and developed an original marketing campaign. We focused on the environmental and neighborhood aspect of the CH Arts District by designing the marketing collateral as elements of a wayfinding system (link) to compliment pre-existing brand elements. For example, they recently installed new road signs on the CH Arts District perimeter that now include the logo. This improved drivers’ awareness of the Arts District brand and geographic location.

(251, 1, '2018-07-07 20:47:16', '2018-07-07 20:47:16', 'For a service learning assignment, I formed a design team with design colleagues, Alicia Smith and Ivy Ye. We partnered with the Capitol Hill Arts District (CH Arts District) to design an awareness campaign to coincide with their new website launch.\r\n<h3>Project Challenges &amp; Goals</h3>\r\nAccording to a recent neighborhood serve, many residents are unaware that Capitol Hill was the first district to be named as part of the Arts &amp; Cultural Districts program by the Seattle City Government (2014). After a couple years of partnering and community building, CH Arts District launched their new website in 2017 to elevate its presence. This print marketing campaign built off the visual tone established on their website and the primary goal was to increase local community’s awareness of the CH Arts District.\r\n\r\nA key challenge for this design assignment was to manage, plan, and coordinate a collaborative design with a team. As the Design Team Lead, I worked closely with Alicia and Ivy to delegate and deliver to our client a comprehensive collateral design and marketing plan.\r\n<h3>Design Strategy</h3>\r\nOur team collaboratively wrote and developed an original marketing campaign. We focused on the environmental and neighborhood aspect of the CH Arts District by designing the marketing collateral as elements of a wayfinding system (link) to compliment pre-existing brand elements. For example, they recently installed new road signs on the CH Arts District perimeter that now include the logo. This improved drivers’ awareness of the Arts District brand and geographic location. We wanted to capitalize on their approach to expand the wayfinding signage for pedestrians and increase people’s perception of the CH Arts District physical boundary.\r\n\r\nInside of the CH Arts District, we empowered community partners to facilitate the neighborhood brand. We distributed small format postcards and stickers to community partners and asked them to display and or sell them within their business.\r\n\r\nDigital assets, like neighborhood photographs and Facebook cover photos, expanded the CH Arts District presence online. Additionally, the hashtags #NowEntering and #CapitolHillArtsDistrict were applied to the collateral to track the conversation online.\r\n<h3>Design Solution</h3>\r\nThe Capitol Hill Arts District requested that we deliver to them each the following:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>11x17 in. poster design</li>\r\n 	<li>6x4 in. postcard design</li>\r\n 	<li>4x4 in. round sticker</li>\r\n 	<li>Facebook cover photo</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n[scroller bg-color="white"]<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-224" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_poster-mockup-side-by-side.jpg" alt="" /><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-225" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_poster-telephone-pole-01.jpg" alt="" /><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-226" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_poster-telephone-pole-02.jpg" alt="" />[/scroller]\r\n\r\n<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-220" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/Capitol-Hill-Arts-District-social-media-mockup.jpg" alt="" />\r\n<h3>Design Process</h3>\r\nAs the Design Team Lead, it was my responsibility to understand the scope of work to be done, coordinate a schedule between the designers and our client, delegate tasks to each team member, and maintain a positive focus on the project goals and deliverables.\r\n\r\nFirst, we got together and brainstormed the idea to use the collateral advertisements to expand the CH Arts District wayfinding signage. One weekend, I spent the day walking around Capitol Hill and captured over 50 photos of public artworks and murals within the Arts District perimeter. Then, our team regrouped and critiqued initial sketches and define our concept more.\r\n\r\nWith the community photographs to use as the background content for the postcard and poster, Alicia and I produced a series of poster layouts; while Ivy designed the stickers. Alicia went ahead and made the postcard layout. I used the photographs to create social media cover photos. Once again, we regrouped and critiqued our team concept, before further refining the details and presenting to the client.\r\n\r\nAfter the final designs were selected by the client, I thoroughly researched local printers and advertisement companies in Capitol Hill to coordinate getting price estimates, printing the collateral, and posting the flyers. I then put everything together into a single presentation the give to the Arts District Steering Committee.\r\n<h3>Project Impact</h3>\r\nIn March 2017, our team presented the campaign to the Arts District Steering Committee during one of their weekly meetings and recommended a course of action for marketing the CH Arts District.\r\n\r\nThe committee response was overwhelmingly positive. They appreciate the versatility of the design system we made. The text content was minimal and remained consistent across the collateral. The CH Arts District logo was prominently feature like they requested, while the interchangeable background photos of CH Arts District murals highlighted the local community.\r\n\r\nThis design system delivered more value because, since the background content is interchangeable, it empowered the committee to swap out photographs with other options we provided, or even to source background photos from district partners and community members. This was a unique approach to the steering committee and they appreciated the adaptability we provided them.\r\n\r\nThe marketing collateral served as advertisements and aided wayfinding. The large format posters were put along the perimeter of the district to identify its boundary, while small collateral items were used inside partner buildings to allow them to associate with the Arts District. The collateral did a solid job notifying people they were entering a new city neighborhood and complemented existing CH Arts District brand signage. The content was focused and clearly promoted shared art and cultural values, which improved people\'s awareness and perception of the CH Arts District.\r\n\r\nOne issue was, the advertisements were posting these on street poles and our design had to compete with local musicians and community event posters. We combated this issue by reducing the text content to its primary elements and adding ample emphasis to the header. The variety of background photos, taken from the local community, gave the poster design a sense of familiarity because much of the featured artwork was iconic for the Capitol Hill Arts District Community.\r\n\r\nIn combination with branded stickers and postcards, we anticipated that residents would interact with CH Arts District collateral as they enter the neighborhood perimeter, then within community partner locations, and begin to associate the partner location with the CH Arts District.\r\n\r\nTo our excitement, many businesses endorsed our efforts to market the CH Arts District. They liked having the responsibility as a community partners to facilitate the neighborhood’s brand and promote community art engagement. Some community partners even opted to put the poster advertisement in their window, too. After all the CH Arts District would not exist if it were not for the nearly 50 neighborhood partners who make up the Capitol Hill Arts District.\r\n\r\nThe committee accepted our proposed marketing plan and the posters, stickers, and postcards were successfully promoted in the Capitol Hill Arts District throughout the summer of 2017.\r\n<h3>Sources</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><a href="http://capitolhillarts.org/now-entering/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Capitol Hill Arts, Now Entering campaign</a></li>\r\n 	<li><a href="https://segd.org/what-wayfinding" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Seattle Environmental Graphic Design: What is Wayfinding?</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n[column_wrap count="2"]\r\n\r\n[column]\r\n<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-223" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_postcards-front-01.jpg" alt="" />\r\n[/column]\r\n\r\n[column]\r\n\r\n<img class="alignnone wp-image-222 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_postcards-back.jpg" alt="" width="2812" height="2824" />\r\n\r\n[/column]\r\n\r\n[/column_wrap]\r\n\r\n[column_wrap count="9"]\r\n[column]\r\n<img class="alignnone wp-image-234 size-thumbnail" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-dark-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />\r\n[/column][column]\r\n<img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-227 alignnone" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-1-red-150x150.jpg" alt="" />\r\n[/column][column]\r\n<img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-228 alignnone" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-2-orange-150x150.jpg" alt="" />\r\n[/column][column]\r\n<img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-229 alignnone" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-3-yellow-150x150.jpg" alt="" />\r\n[/column][column]\r\n<img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-230 alignnone" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-4-green-150x150.jpg" alt="" />\r\n[/column][column]\r\n<img class="alignnone wp-image-231 size-thumbnail" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-5-teal-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />\r\n[/column][column]\r\n<img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-232 alignnone" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-6-blue-150x150.jpg" alt="" />\r\n[/column][column]\r\n<img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-233 alignnone" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-7-purple-150x150.jpg" alt="" />\r\n[/column][column]\r\n<img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-235 alignnone" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-light-150x150.jpg" alt="" />\r\n[/column]\r\n[/column_wrap]', 'Capitol Hill Arts District', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '217-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-07-07 20:47:16', '2018-07-07 20:47:16', '', 217, 'http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/217-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

(262, 1, '2018-07-09 17:57:59', '2018-07-09 17:57:59', '<h3>Background</h3>\r\nFor a service learning assignment, I formed a design team with colleagues, Alicia Smith and Ivy Ye. We partnered with the Capitol Hill Arts District (CH Arts District) to design an awareness campaign to coincide with their new website launch.\r\n<h3>Project Challenges &amp; Goals</h3>\r\nAccording to a recent neighborhood survey, the majority of residents were unaware that Capitol Hill Arts District even exists. It was the first neighborhood to be named as part of the Arts &amp; Cultural Districts program by the Seattle City Government (2014). CH Arts District launched their new website in 2017 to elevate its presence. My team’s primary goal was to build off the visual tone established on their website and to increase local community’s awareness of the CH Arts District.\r\n\r\nAnother key challenge for this design assignment was to manage, plan, and coordinate a collaborative design with a team. As the Design Team Lead, I worked closely with Alicia and Ivy to delegate and deliver to our client a comprehensive collateral design and marketing plan.\r\n<h3>Design Strategy</h3>\r\nOur team collaboratively wrote and developed an original marketing campaign. We focused on the environmental and neighborhood aspect of the CH Arts District by designing the marketing collateral as elements of a wayfinding system to compliment pre-existing brand elements. For example, CH Arts District recently installed new road signs that include their logo on the District perimeter. This improved drivers’ awareness of the Arts District brand and geographic location. We capitalize on their approach buy advertising the large format posters along the perimeter. This expanded the wayfinding signage for pedestrians and increase people’s perception of the CH Arts District physical boundary.\r\n\r\nInside of the CH Arts District, we empowered community partners to facilitate the neighborhood brand. We distributed small format postcards and stickers to community partners and asked them to display and sell them within their business.\r\n\r\nDigital assets, like neighborhood photographs and Facebook cover photos, expanded the CH Arts District presence online. Additionally, the hashtags #NowEntering and #CapitolHillArtsDistrict were applied to the collateral to track the conversation online.\r\n<h3>Design Solution</h3>\r\nThe Capitol Hill Arts District requested that we deliver to them each the following:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>11x17 in. poster design</li>\r\n 	<li>6x4 in. postcard design</li>\r\n 	<li>4x4 in. round sticker</li>\r\n 	<li>Facebook cover photo</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n[scroller bg-color="white"]<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-224" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_poster-mockup-side-by-side.jpg" alt="" /><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-225" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_poster-telephone-pole-01.jpg" alt="" /><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-226" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_poster-telephone-pole-02.jpg" alt="" />[/scroller]\r\n\r\n<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-220" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/Capitol-Hill-Arts-District-social-media-mockup.jpg" alt="" />\r\n<h3>Design Process</h3>\r\nAs the Design Team Lead, it was my responsibility to understand the scope of work to be done, coordinate a schedule between the designers and our client, delegate tasks to each team member, and maintain a positive focus on the project goals and deliverables.\r\n\r\nThe design process included reviewing existing collateral and advertisements and brainstorming on ways to expand up on existing wayfinding signage. Utilizing over 50 photos of public artworks and murals within the Arts district, our team developed initial sketches and defined our concept. Next we developed the postcard and poster content and produced a series of layouts and sticker designs. The photographs were also used to create social media cover photos. Refined concepts were present to the client for final design and approval. The project scope also included researching of local printers and advertisement companies, coordinating and securing price estimates, printing the collateral and posting the flyer and presenting to the Arts District Steering Committee following final design approval from client.\r\n<h3>Project Impact</h3>\r\nOur team presented the campaign to the Arts District Steering Committee and recommended a course of action for marketing the CH Arts District.\r\n\r\nThe committee response was overwhelmingly positive. They appreciate the versatility of the design system we made. The text content was minimal and remained consistent across the collateral. The CH Arts District logo was prominently feature like they requested, while the interchangeable background photos of CH Arts District murals highlighted the local community. The interchangeable backgrounds empowered the committee to swap out photographs with other options we provided. We even proposed to source background photos from district partners and community members to delivered more community value. This was a unique approach to the and CH Arts District committee appreciated the variety and adaptability we provided them.\r\n\r\nThe marketing collateral served as advertisements and aided wayfinding. The large format posters were put along the perimeter of the district to identify its boundary, while small collateral items were used inside partner buildings to allow them to associate with the Arts District. The collateral did a solid job notifying people they were entering a new city neighborhood and complemented existing CH Arts District brand signage. The content was focused and clearly promoted shared art and cultural values, which improved people\'s awareness and perception of the CH Arts District.\r\n\r\nIn combination with branded stickers and postcards, we anticipated that residents would interact with CH Arts District collateral as they enter the neighborhood perimeter, then within community partner locations, and begin to associate the partner location with the CH Arts District. By diversifying our advertisements and the locations we marketed, it allowed more audience touch points to increase its impact.\r\n\r\nTo our excitement, many businesses endorsed our efforts to market the CH Arts District. They liked having the responsibility as a community partner to facilitate the neighborhood’s brand. Some community partners even opted to put the poster advertisement in their window.\r\n\r\nThe committee accepted our proposed marketing plan and the posters, stickers, and postcards were successfully promoted in the Capitol Hill Arts District throughout the summer of 2017.\r\n<h3>Sources</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><a href="http://capitolhillarts.org/now-entering/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Capitol Hill Arts, Now Entering campaign page</a></li>\r\n 	<li><a href="https://segd.org/what-wayfinding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">What is Wayfinding? — Seattle Environmental Graphic Design</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n[column_wrap count="2"]\r\n\r\n[column]\r\n<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-223" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_postcards-front-01.jpg" alt="" />\r\n[/column]\r\n\r\n[column]\r\n\r\n<img class="alignnone wp-image-222 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_postcards-back.jpg" alt="" width="2812" height="2824" />\r\n\r\n[/column]\r\n\r\n[/column_wrap]\r\n\r\n[column_wrap count="9"]\r\n[column]\r\n<img class="alignnone wp-image-234 size-thumbnail" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-dark-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />\r\n[/column][column]\r\n<img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-227 alignnone" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-1-red-150x150.jpg" alt="" />\r\n[/column][column]\r\n<img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-228 alignnone" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-2-orange-150x150.jpg" alt="" />\r\n[/column][column]\r\n<img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-229 alignnone" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-3-yellow-150x150.jpg" alt="" />\r\n[/column][column]\r\n<img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-230 alignnone" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-4-green-150x150.jpg" alt="" />\r\n[/column][column]\r\n<img class="alignnone wp-image-231 size-thumbnail" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-5-teal-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />\r\n[/column][column]\r\n<img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-232 alignnone" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-6-blue-150x150.jpg" alt="" />\r\n[/column][column]\r\n<img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-233 alignnone" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-7-purple-150x150.jpg" alt="" />\r\n[/column][column]\r\n<img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-235 alignnone" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-light-150x150.jpg" alt="" />\r\n[/column]\r\n[/column_wrap]', 'Capitol Hill Arts District', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '217-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-07-09 17:57:59', '2018-07-09 17:57:59', '', 217, 'http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/217-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),
(263, 1, '2018-07-09 18:05:23', '2018-07-09 18:05:23', 'For the Capitol Hill Housing leasing department, I conceptualized, designed and developed a leasing packet for an affordable housing development in the Central District called the Liberty Bank Building. The building is a multi-use apartment complex with entirely low-income eligible units and over 2,500 square feet of commercial space for local businesses. It is currently under construction and set to open in February 2019.\r\n<h3>Background</h3>\r\nThe Liberty Bank Building is the result of a collective partnership between Africa Town Central District, Byrd Barr Place, Black Community Impact Alliance, the Capitol HIll Housing Foundation, local community leaders and founders of the Liberty Bank. This historic project aspires to preserve the legacy of the first black-owned bank in the western United States by continuing to support the community for years to come. We wanted to highlight this legacy, preserve the existing identity of the Central District, and steward in a new generation of community engagement.\r\n<h3>Project Challenges &amp; Goals</h3>\r\nHistorically, the Seattle City government divested from the Central District. This segregated community became a hub for pan-African and migrant community culture. Today it is experiencing rapid urban development. As rent increases faster than the existing community members are able to afford, they become displaced from their homes. The Liberty Bank Bank building will provide affordable housing for these very residents, in a continued effort to preserve the Central District’s cultural identity.\r\n\r\nExisting Liberty Bank material, while resourceful, was lengthy and complex, making it impractical for the target audience. A key assignment for this project was creating leasing content that would be understandable and usable for all members of the community.\r\n\r\nThe leasing packet design was heavily influenced by all these factors. The project goals were:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>to clarify the eligibility requirements for affordable housing</li>\r\n 	<li>walk applicants through the leasing process and timeline for the Liberty Bank Building</li>\r\n 	<li>affirmatively market to audiences affected by rapid urbanization in the Central District</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Design Strategy</h3>\r\nThe design needed to be tailored to a broad range of audience segments. The primary audience was individuals and families living in the Central District who qualify for affordable housing. The secondary audience was community members and small businesses, particularly of pan-African decent, affected by displacement in the Central District. The third audience, was public officials, agencies, and organization who work with affordable housing.\r\n\r\nTo clarify the eligibility requirements for affordable housing and walk applicants through the leasing process, I neatly organized complex leasing information in a format accessible to a broad audience whom are largely unfamiliar with affordable housing regulation in Seattle.\r\n<h3>Design Solution</h3>\r\n[scroller bg-color="LightSlateGrey"]<img class="alignnone wp-image-175 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018-05-04_LBB-leasing-packet-cover-refinements_compressed_Page_1.jpg" alt="" width="1224" height="1584" /> <img class="alignnone wp-image-176 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018-05-04_LBB-leasing-packet-cover-refinements_compressed_Page_2.jpg" alt="" width="2448" height="1584" /> <img class="alignnone wp-image-177 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018-05-04_LBB-leasing-packet-cover-refinements_compressed_Page_3.jpg" alt="" width="2448" height="1584" /> <img class="alignnone wp-image-178 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018-05-04_LBB-leasing-packet-cover-refinements_compressed_Page_4.jpg" alt="" width="2448" height="1584" /> <img class="alignnone wp-image-179 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018-05-04_LBB-leasing-packet-cover-refinements_compressed_Page_5.jpg" alt="" width="1224" height="1584" />[/scroller]\r\n\r\nThe Capitol Hill Housing Foundation hired me to deliver a single leasing packet of the following items:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>General building information including amenities, photos, and location map</li>\r\n 	<li>Affordable housing process overview</li>\r\n 	<li>Income requirements for applying</li>\r\n 	<li>A timeline of the project development and leasing</li>\r\n 	<li>Frequently Asked Questions</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Design Process</h3>\r\nLeasing affordable housing differs from non-subsidized apartments; and the Liberty Bank Building itself poses a unique application process. While focusing on conceptual development with moodboards, typography and color schemes, I worked with the team to categorize, synthesize and tailor content strategically.\r\n\r\nThe visual design is intuitive and simply explains affordable housing, the application process, and eligibility requirements using accessible language. Visual graphs and tables help applicants interactively determine their eligibility, while a four step visual breakdown walks them through the leasing process. We sourced historic photos from the Liberty Bank partners, and composed them with photos of the new Liberty Bank Building. I coordinated with the client to render a more diverse group of people in the building renderings. I was sure to prioritize contact information; and developed a Frequently Asked Questions spread. I also included a timeline of key dates for the project construction and leasing process.\r\n<h3>Project Impact</h3>\r\nThe layout itself is a huge improvement from the single word document the partners began with. Including photos of the historic Central District and current community events, drastically improved the packets relatability. The use of visual motifs, typographic hierarchy and layout, and brand consistency were driving forces behind achieving project goals.\r\n\r\nThe Capitol Hill Housing Association ensures their approach to each community building is both intentional and affective in targeting individuals in need of affordable housing. Upon beginning this assignment, there were minor tensions rising between community partners as its construction progressed. The success of this collateral project strengthened the Liberty Bank Building partners’ trust in Capitol Hill Housings’ ability to be aware of its context and deliver content that is relevant to this project’s audience.\r\n\r\nThe partners responded very positively to the leasing packet design. The project delivered on schedule and within the project budget. Once the Liberty Bank Building partners begin actively marketing, it is anticipated this leasing packet will allow local community members to become more familiar with the affordable housing application process and give them the confidence to inquire about living at the Liberty Bank Building.\r\n\r\nThe Liberty Bank Building partners utilized the leasing packet to affirmatively market to audiences affected by rapid urbanization. They planned to host local events to build community and pass out these leasing packets to residents in need. The visual design compliments their marketing tactics in a way that communicates the history of the Liberty Bank, expresses the future tone of the Liberty Bank Building, and respects the pan-African community in the Central District.\r\n<h3>Sources</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><a href="http://libertybankbuilding.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Liberty Bank Building</a></li>\r\n 	<li><a href="http://www.africatownlandtrust.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Africa Town Land Trust, Central District</a></li>\r\n 	<li><a href="https://byrdbarrplace.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Byrd Barr Place</a></li>\r\n 	<li><a href="http://david-harris-wkj7.squarespace.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black Community Impact Alliance</a></li>\r\n 	<li><a href="https://www.capitolhillhousing.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Capitol Hill Housing Foundation</a></li>\r\n</ul>', 'The Liberty Bank Building', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '160-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-07-09 18:05:23', '2018-07-09 18:05:23', '', 160, 'http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/160-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

He contracted fellow designer, Kenzie Nicholson, and I to execute the brand design. Kenzie and I collaboratively envisioned a brand identity; developed a handout menu, large format menu and food packaging for CMB’s grand opening.\r\n<h3>Project Challenges &amp; Goals</h3>\r\nCheese Meats Bread is an international take on an american classic—the grilled cheese sandwich. Mr. Chung planned to open in the Uwajimaya Village marketplace in the International District.\r\n<h3>Design Strategy</h3>\r\nDuring the research phase Kenzie and I talked largely about how to add an international flare to an American classic without having the brand be offensive or too intrusive for a largely international audience.\r\n<h3>Design Solution</h3>\r\nKenzie and I worked collaboratively throughout the project brainstorming, concept development, and refinement phases. When executing the final deliverables, kenzie created the typographic pattern and packaging design, while I focused on the large format menu board, small take-out menu, and brand identity style guide.\r\n\r\n[image_block][scroller]<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-185" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CMB_style-guide_8.5x11.jpg" alt="" /><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-188" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CMB-menu_6x11.jpg" alt="" /><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-187" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CMB_menu-board_6x4ft_opt-2.jpg" alt="" />[/scroller]\r\n<h4>Brand style guide</h4>\r\n<h4>6x11 in. takeout menu</h4>\r\n<h4>6x4 ft. menu board</h4>\r\n[/image_block]\r\n<h3>Design Process</h3>\r\nWhile brainstorming and exploring concepts, Kenzie and I provided the client with numerous concepts, each of which approached the CMB brand from a unique lens. Upon listening more closely to general feedback from others and the client’s reaction to our presentation, they liked the variety of font selections we provided, but overall they gravitated towards more simpler fonts and cleaner illustrations. We decided on a typographic solution that used a simple typographic logo mark and a typographic pattern as the primary brand elements with a gooey yellow accent color.\r\n<h3>Project Impact</h3>\r\nWe successfully delivered the brand identity packet to the client on schedule and within our budget. Afterwards, I maintained a positive relationship with the client and both design colleagues. CMB is open today and thriving in Seattle’s International District at the Uwajimaya Village market place.\r\n<h3>Sources</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><a href="https://cheesemeatsbread.life/">Cheese Meats Bread</a></li>\r\n 	<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chriselvis/">Client Relations: Chris Mercurio</a></li>\r\n 	<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kenzie-nicholson/">Designer: Kenzie Nicholson</a></li>\r\n</ul>', 'Cheese Meats Bread', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '183-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-07-09 18:09:38', '2018-07-09 18:09:38', '', 183, 'http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/183-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),
(266, 1, '2018-07-09 18:16:30', '2018-07-09 18:16:30', 'Capitol Hill Housing (CHH) is a public corporation organized by the City of Seattle. Their mission is to build vibrant and engaged communities through affordable housing and community development. In total, CHH manages approximately 50 properties, each with eligibility requirements ranging from low-income, elderly, disabled, veteran and other eligibility restricted units.\r\n<h3>Background</h3>\r\nCapitol Hill Housing Resident Service department employs Resident Service Coordinators (RSC) to inform, coordinate and provide resources to its diverse residents. The RSC primarily communicate with residents through information sheets, advertisements on community boards, door-to-door tactics, community, and building events and direct one-on-one contact. They serve as the central resource for all residents living in CHH properties, providing a range of services including general questions, hosting community events and coordinating need-based services such as rental assistance, live-in health care and transportation services to name a few.\r\n<h3>Project Challenges &amp; Goals</h3>\r\nAccording to CHH resident surveys, less than half the residents were aware that CHH provided individualized support through its Resident Services Program. Additionally, the RSC relied heavily on Microsoft word, so it became important to create a template system any RSC could use on any type of computer. As such, the project goals were identified as follows:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Inform residents about RSC and increase awareness of the many services available</li>\r\n 	<li>Simplify the layout and be consistent with the CHH brand</li>\r\n 	<li>Improve the collateral functionality and usability for RSC</li>\r\n 	<li>Improve and increase the visual accessibility for CHH’s diverse residents</li>\r\n 	<li>Improve and increase the trust between resident and RSC in individual communities</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Design Strategy</h3>\r\nTo achieve these goals, I brainstormed the visual design by assessing technical concerns, researching the methods in which RSC communicate with residents and the reviewing the overall brand image and messaging of CHH. To increase overall brand awareness, I set forth to unify the CHH brand image and develop a template system that could be unique for individual properties, yet consistent with the larger CHH brand. Additionally, I created pieces that were simply formatted, easily customizable and implementable by the RSC in each residential community.\r\n<h3>Design Solutions</h3>\r\nThe client hired me to provide graphic design services for five collateral items most utilized by the RSC. The pieces were to be redesigned, while meeting the aforementioned goals in to the five unified, brand consistent templates:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Building Welcome Sheets</li>\r\n 	<li>RSC Persona Sheets</li>\r\n 	<li>Monthly Events Calendar</li>\r\n 	<li>Event Flyers</li>\r\n 	<li>Resource One Sheets</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n[image_block]\r\n<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-49" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_Resident-Services-poster_11x17-663x1024.jpg" alt="" />\r\n<h4>Resident Services Poster</h4>\r\nIn addition to the five collateral templates, I designed a large format poster to advertise CHH Resident Services. It primarily informs residents of the services available to them. We proposed to mount these posters on community boards in public building spaces, around the building property and within CHH offices. This poster design acts as the outward, public facing representation of the CHH Resident Services available.\r\n[/image_block]\r\n\r\n[image_block][scroller]<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_welcome-sheetgeneral_8.5x11.jpg" alt="" /><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_welcome-sheetJoeyG_8.5x11.jpg" alt="" /><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-34" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tmpl_individual-rsc-768x1024.jpg" alt="" /><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-32" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/poster_resident-services-e1530318746544-834x1024.jpg" alt="" />[/scroller]\r\n<h4>Building Welcome and RSC Persona Sheets</h4>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon move in, residents receive a packet which includes the building welcome and RSC persona sheets. The building welcome sheet informs residents about CHH and resources available through the Resident Services program. The RSC persona sheet introduces the specific RS Coordinator supporting the residents’ property. Both these documents are intended to welcome residents and provide them essential resources, contact information, and other important details about CHH and RSC.</span>\r\n[/image_block]\r\n\r\n[image_block][scroller]<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-53" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE-calendar_11x8.5.jpg" alt="" /> <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-35" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tmpl_residence-calendar-e1530319018147-1024x803.jpg" alt="" />[/scroller]\r\n<h4>Monthly Events Calendar</h4>\r\nMonthly calendars specific to each property highlight upcoming community events. They are available online, by email and posted in community spaces. After creating a 2018-19 monthly calendar template with updated styles, I added additional content to the footer, specific to each RSC and building property. This allows the RSC to put their contact information and specific building information on the calendars for residents to easily reference.\r\n[/image_block]\r\n\r\n[image_block][scroller]<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_event-poster_8.5x11.jpg" alt="" /> <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-47" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/BLANK_event-flyer_x2_5.5x8.5-1024x791.jpg" alt="" /> <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-33" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tmpl_event-flyers-e1530319332673-797x1024.jpg" alt="" />[/scroller]\r\n<h4>Event Flyers</h4>\r\nEvent flyers are posted in community spaces to advertise a variety of events and workshops. For maximum ease of use and flexibility, I designed a variable sidebar layout for things like recurrent event dates and event sign-ups. RSCs can choose between having a single event date or multiple recurring events.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, there is an option for a sign-up content block with a variable height, allowing for maximum customization. I also created a half-sheet event template that reduces event information to its hook, a primary message and call to action, for use by the RSC as handouts for local, building specific events.\r\n[/image_block]\r\n\r\n[image_block][scroller]<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-50" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_resource-one-sheet_8.5x11-791x1024.jpg" alt="" /> <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-36" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tmpl_resource-one-sheet-e1530319531779-819x1024.jpg" alt="" />[/scroller]\r\n<h4>Resource One Sheets</h4>\r\nThese templates list all relevant contact information for each resource category. I created a typographic system and grid layout that adapts to each collateral template. The system I conceived maintains the appropriate balance between text legibility and readability. This one sheet example is the simplest form of typography and grid layout utilized across every template.\r\n[/image_block]\r\n<h3>Design Process</h3>\r\nIn developing the collateral pieces, the challenges and goals of the client were kept in the forefront. As such, in all steps of the project development the following were considered: awareness and consistency; accessibility; and usability.\r\n<h4>Awareness &amp; Consistency</h4>\r\nConsistency affects people’s awareness and trust of a brand. If residents aren’t clear what the RSC provide and who they are in relation to CHH, then they are likely to have less faith in the services provided. I directly addressed this issue through a systematically implemented visual design. Through use of typography, white space, graphic elements and color, I achieved overall visual consistency between each collateral template.\r\n<h4>Accessibility</h4>\r\nThe visual design compliments the content strategy and does not detract from it. We simplified the text and used language understood by a general audience. I also utilized a relatively large font size to improve legibility for residents with visual impairments. Attention was also paid to color usage, to increase accessibility for color visually impaired people.\r\n<h4>Usability</h4>\r\nTo provide maximum ease of use for the RSC, who may not have a background in design or layout programs, I chose Adobe InDesign to make the templates. The Adobe InDesign has excellent interface with Adobe Acrobat, the program used by the majority of CHH employees. This has resulted in great ease of use for the RSC, allowing for editable content while maintaining overall brand consistency and increased design awareness.\r\n<h3>Project Results</h3>\r\nThe overall response from the Client, CHH employees, Resident Service Coordinators and residents was overwhelmingly positive. The visual design and functionality of my project deliverables exceeded their expectations. In fact, after using the new templates, several RSC requested more variations for the event flyers, resulting in additional project work. In recreating these design pieces for CHH, I created a visual design similar enough to the existing look to maintain the familiarity of the old styles, while drastically improving brand accessibility, functionality, consistency and awareness. Our focus on content strategy, language and visual harmony allowed the simple style to accommodate the diverse audiences with propriety and appeal.\r\n\r\n[scroller]\r\n<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-71" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/IMG_3094_small.jpg" alt="Capitol Hill Housing community event" /> <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-90" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/IMG_2666-768x1024.jpg" alt="" /> <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-89" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/IMG_2499-1024x768.jpg" alt="" /> <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-70" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CAPHILLHOUSING-186-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="Ashwin Warrior enters the Capitol Hill Housing offices on 12th Ave." />[/scroller]', 'Capitol Hill Housing Resident Services', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '23-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-07-09 18:16:30', '2018-07-09 18:16:30', '', 23, 'http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/23-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

I excel at composing and formulating information into clear visuals that demonstrate mature application of design theory and practice. With a diverse background in digital and print design, I work with local businesses to develop impact driven collateral including marketing tools, brand identity, templates, website design, presentations and visual strategies.\r\n\r\nMy experience working with a startup, an architecture studio, designing for Seattle businesses, and serving on a 501(c)(3) board as the Design and Marketing Chair, allowed me the opportunity to gain in depth knowledge about the professional and creative sides of design.\r\n<h3>People tell me I am good at</h3>\r\n<h4>Asking Questions</h4>\r\nMy process is driven by curiosity. I address challenges creatively by asking questions first. Afterwards, I thoroughly research target markets, audience demographics, typography and design patterns. At the same time, hand sketching and photographic moodboards compliment my research. This part of my process inspires further conceptual development and helps me understand the variables involved — to properly execute a visual strategy that achieves the project goals.\r\n<h4>Iteration &amp; Variation</h4>\r\nI use an iterative design process to explore many design concepts. Team critiques are an important component to iteration. It opens up dialogue between the design concept and its stakeholders.

(280, 1, '2018-07-09 20:21:23', '2018-07-09 20:21:23', 'For the Capitol Hill Housing leasing department, I conceptualized, designed and developed a leasing packet for an affordable housing development in the Central District called the Liberty Bank Building. The building is a multi-use apartment complex with entirely low-income eligible units and over 2,500 square feet of commercial space for local businesses. It is currently under construction and scheduled to open February 2019.\r\n<h3>Background</h3>\r\nThe Liberty Bank Building is the result of a collective partnership between Africa Town Central District, Byrd Barr Place, Black Community Impact Alliance, the Capitol Hill Housing Foundation, local community leaders and founders of the Liberty Bank. This historic project aspires to preserve the legacy of <em>the Liberty Bank</em>, "the first Black-owned bank west of the Mississippi, founded as a community response to redlining and disinvestment in Central Seattle" (libertybankbuilding.org).\r\n\r\nHistorically, the City government divested from the Central District. This segregated community became a hub for pan-African and migrant community culture. Today it is experiencing rapid urban development, and as rent increases faster than the existing community members are able to afford, they become displaced from their homes.\r\n\r\nThe Liberty Bank Building is designed to be affordable to everyday people, and aspires to continue to support the community for years to come. We wanted to highlight this legacy, preserve the existing identity of the Central District, and steward in a new generation of community engagement.\r\n<h3>Project Challenges &amp; Goals</h3>\r\nExisting Liberty Bank material, while resourceful, was lengthy and complex, making it impractical for the target audience. A key assignment for this project was to create leasing content that would be understandable and usable for <em>all members</em> of the community—<em>it needed to be accessible</em>.\r\n\r\nThe leasing packet design was heavily influenced by all these factors. The project goals were:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>to clarify the eligibility requirements for affordable housing</li>\r\n 	<li>walk applicants through the leasing process and timeline for the Liberty Bank Building</li>\r\n 	<li>affirmatively market to audiences affected by rapid urbanization in the Central District</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Design Strategy</h3>\r\nThe design needed to be tailored to a broad range of audience segments. The primary audience was individuals and families living in the Central District who qualify for affordable housing. The secondary audience was community members and small businesses, particularly of pan-African decent, affected by rapidly rising rent. The third audience, was public officials, agencies, and organization who work in the housing marketplace.\r\n\r\nTo clarify the eligibility requirements for affordable housing and walk applicants through the leasing process, I neatly organized complex leasing information in a format accessible to a broad audience whom are largely unfamiliar with affordable housing regulation in Seattle, but have a deeply rooted history in the Central District.\r\n<h3>Design Solution</h3>\r\n[scroller bg-color="LightSlateGrey"]<img class="alignnone wp-image-175 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018-05-04_LBB-leasing-packet-cover-refinements_compressed_Page_1.jpg" alt="" width="1224" height="1584" /> <img class="alignnone wp-image-176 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018-05-04_LBB-leasing-packet-cover-refinements_compressed_Page_2.jpg" alt="" width="2448" height="1584" /> <img class="alignnone wp-image-177 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018-05-04_LBB-leasing-packet-cover-refinements_compressed_Page_3.jpg" alt="" width="2448" height="1584" /> <img class="alignnone wp-image-178 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018-05-04_LBB-leasing-packet-cover-refinements_compressed_Page_4.jpg" alt="" width="2448" height="1584" /> <img class="alignnone wp-image-179 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018-05-04_LBB-leasing-packet-cover-refinements_compressed_Page_5.jpg" alt="" width="1224" height="1584" />[/scroller]\r\n\r\nThe Capitol Hill Housing Foundation hired me to deliver a single leasing packet of the following items:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>General building information including amenities, photos, and location map</li>\r\n 	<li>Affordable housing process overview</li>\r\n 	<li>Income requirements for applying</li>\r\n 	<li>A timeline of the project development and leasing process</li>\r\n 	<li>Frequently Asked Questions sheet</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Design Process</h3>\r\nLeasing affordable housing differs from non-subsidized apartments; and the Liberty Bank Building itself poses a unique application process. While focusing on conceptual development with moodboards, typography and color schemes, I worked with the team to categorize, synthesize and tailor content strategically.\r\n\r\nThe visual design is intuitive and simply explains affordable housing, the application process, and eligibility requirements use accessible language. Visual graphs and tables help applicants interactively determine their eligibility, while a four step visual breakdown walks them through the leasing process.\r\n\r\nWe sourced historic photos from the Liberty Bank partners, and composed them with photos of the new Liberty Bank Building. I coordinated with the client to render a more diverse group of people in the building renderings. I was sure to prioritize contact information; and developed a Frequently Asked Questions spread. I also included a timeline of key dates for the project construction and leasing process.\r\n<h3>Project Impact</h3>\r\nThe layout itself is a huge improvement from the single word document the partners began with. Including photos of the historic Central District and current community events, drastically improved the packets relatability. The use of visual motifs, typographic hierarchy and layout, and brand consistency were driving forces behind achieving project goals.\r\n\r\nThe partners responded very positively to the leasing packet design. The project delivered on schedule and within the project budget. Once the Liberty Bank Building partners begin actively marketing, it is anticipated this leasing packet will allow local community members to become more familiar with the affordable housing application process and give them the confidence to inquire about living at the Liberty Bank Building.\r\n\r\nThe Liberty Bank Building partners utilized the leasing packet to affirmatively market to audiences affected by rapid urbanization. They plan to host local events to build community and pass out these leasing packets to residents in need. The visual design compliments their marketing tactics in a way that communicates the history of the Liberty Bank, expresses the future tone of the Liberty Bank Building, and respects the pan-African community in the Central District.\r\n<h3>Sources</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><a href="http://libertybankbuilding.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Liberty Bank Building</a></li>\r\n 	<li><a href="http://www.africatownlandtrust.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Africa Town Land Trust, Central District</a></li>\r\n 	<li><a href="https://byrdbarrplace.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Byrd Barr Place</a></li>\r\n 	<li><a href="http://david-harris-wkj7.squarespace.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black Community Impact Alliance</a></li>\r\n 	<li><a href="https://www.capitolhillhousing.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Capitol Hill Housing Foundation</a></li>\r\n</ul>', 'The Liberty Bank Building', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '160-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-07-09 20:21:23', '2018-07-09 20:21:23', '', 160, 'http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/160-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

(282, 1, '2018-07-09 20:44:01', '2018-07-09 20:44:01', 'Capitol Hill Housing (CHH) is a public corporation organized by the City of Seattle. Their mission is to build vibrant and engaged communities through affordable housing and community development. In total, CHH manages approximately 50 properties, each with eligibility requirements ranging from low-income, elderly, disabled, veteran and other eligibility restricted units.\r\n<h3>Background</h3>\r\nCapitol Hill Housing Resident Service department employs Resident Service Coordinators (RSC) to inform, coordinate and provide resources to its diverse residents. The RSC primarily communicate with residents through information sheets, advertisements on community boards, door-to-door tactics, community, and building events and direct one-on-one contact. They serve as the central resource for all residents living in CHH properties, providing a range of services including general questions, hosting community events and coordinating need-based services such as rental assistance, live-in health care and transportation services to name a few.\r\n<h3>Project Challenges &amp; Goals</h3>\r\nAccording to CHH resident surveys, less than half the residents were aware that CHH provided individualized support through its Resident Services Program. Additionally, the RSC relied heavily on Microsoft word, so it became important to create a template system any RSC could use on any type of computer. As such, the project goals were identified as follows:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Inform residents about RSC and increase awareness of the many services available</li>\r\n 	<li>Simplify the layout and be consistent with the CHH brand</li>\r\n 	<li>Improve the collateral functionality and usability for RSC</li>\r\n 	<li>Improve and increase the visual accessibility for CHH’s diverse residents</li>\r\n 	<li>Improve and increase the trust between resident and RSC in individual communities</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Design Strategy</h3>\r\nTo achieve these goals, I brainstormed the visual design by assessing technical concerns, researching the methods in which RSC communicate with residents, and reviewed the overall brand image and messaging of CHH. To increase overall brand awareness, I set forth to develop a template system that is unique for individual properties, yet consistent with the larger CHH brand. Additionally, my deliverables were simply formatted and easily customizable for the RSC.\r\n<h3>Design Solutions</h3>\r\nThe client hired me to provide graphic design services for five collateral items most utilized by the RSC. The existing collateral was redesigned to met the aforementioned goals into five unified, brand consistent templates:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Building Welcome Sheets</li>\r\n 	<li>RSC Persona Sheets</li>\r\n 	<li>Monthly Events Calendar</li>\r\n 	<li>Event Flyers</li>\r\n 	<li>Resource One Sheets</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n[image_block]\r\n<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-49" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_Resident-Services-poster_11x17-663x1024.jpg" alt="" />\r\n<h4>Resident Services Poster</h4>\r\nIn addition to the five collateral templates, I designed a large format poster to advertise CHH Resident Services. It primarily informs residents of the services available to them. We proposed to mount these posters on community boards in public building spaces, around the building property and within CHH offices. This poster design acts as the outward, public facing representation of the CHH Resident Services available.\r\n[/image_block]\r\n\r\n[image_block][scroller]<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_welcome-sheetgeneral_8.5x11.jpg" alt="" /><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_welcome-sheetJoeyG_8.5x11.jpg" alt="" /><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-34" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tmpl_individual-rsc-768x1024.jpg" alt="" /><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-32" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/poster_resident-services-e1530318746544-834x1024.jpg" alt="" />[/scroller]\r\n<h4>Building Welcome and RSC Persona Sheets</h4>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon move in, residents receive a packet which includes the building welcome and RSC persona sheets.

They are available online, by email and posted in community spaces. After creating a 2018-19 monthly calendar template with updated styles, I added additional content to the footer, for each RSC and building property. This allows the RSC to put their contact information and specific building information on the calendars for residents to easily reference.\r\n[/image_block]\r\n\r\n[image_block][scroller]<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_event-poster_8.5x11.jpg" alt="" /> <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-47" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/BLANK_event-flyer_x2_5.5x8.5-1024x791.jpg" alt="" /> <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-33" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tmpl_event-flyers-e1530319332673-797x1024.jpg" alt="" />[/scroller]\r\n<h4>Event Flyers</h4>\r\nEvent flyers posted in community spaces advertise a variety of events and workshops. For maximum ease of use and flexibility, I designed a variable sidebar layout for things like recurrent dates and event sign-ups. RSCs can choose between having a single event date or multiple recurring events, both, or neither.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, there is an option for a sign-up content block with a variable height, allowing for maximum customization. I also created a half-sheet event template that reduces event information to its hook, a primary message and call to action, for use by the RSC as handouts for local, building specific events.\r\n[/image_block]\r\n\r\n[image_block][scroller]<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-50" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_resource-one-sheet_8.5x11-791x1024.jpg" alt="" /> <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-36" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tmpl_resource-one-sheet-e1530319531779-819x1024.jpg" alt="" />[/scroller]\r\n<h4>Resource One Sheets</h4>\r\nThese templates list all relevant contact information for each resource category. I created a typographic system and grid layout that adapts to each collateral template. The system I conceived maintains the appropriate balance between text legibility and readability. This one sheet example is the simplest form of typography and grid layout utilized across every template.\r\n[/image_block]\r\n<h3>Design Process</h3>\r\nThe challenges and client\'s goals were kept at the forefront of my process while designing the collateral. During each step of the project, the following were considered: consistency; accessibility; and usability.\r\n<h4>Consistency</h4>\r\nConsistency affects people’s awareness and trust of a brand. If residents aren’t clear what the RSC provide and who they are in relation to CHH, then they are likely to have less faith in the services provided. I directly addressed this issue through a systematically implemented visual design. Through use of typography, white space, graphic elements and color, I achieved overall visual consistency between all collateral templates.\r\n<h4>Accessibility</h4>\r\nThe visual design compliments the content strategy and does not detract from it. We simplified the text and used language understood by a general audience. I also utilized a relatively large font size to improve legibility and tested the color contrast, to ensure residents with visual impairments could view the content.\r\n<h4>Usability</h4>\r\nTo provide maximum ease of use for the RSC, who may not have a background in design or layout programs, I chose Adobe InDesign to make the templates. The Adobe InDesign has excellent interface with Adobe Acrobat, a program used by the majority of CHH employees. This resulted in great ease of use for the RSC, allowing for editable content while maintaining overall brand consistency.\r\n<h3>Project Results</h3>\r\nThe overall response from the Client, CHH employees, Resident Service Coordinators and residents was overwhelmingly positive. The visual design and functionality of my project deliverables exceeded their expectations. In fact, after using the new templates, several RSC requested more variations for the event flyers, resulting in additional project work.\r\n\r\nWhile redesigning the RSC collateral, I created a visual design inspired by the existing CHH brand. It maintained the familiarity of the old styles, while drastically improving RSC brand accessibility, usability, and consistency. Our focus on content strategy, language and visual harmony allowed the collateral to accommodate the diverse audiences with propriety and appeal.\r\n\r\n[scroller]\r\n<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-71" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/IMG_3094_small.jpg" alt="Capitol Hill Housing community event" /> <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-90" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/IMG_2666-768x1024.jpg" alt="" /> <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-89" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/IMG_2499-1024x768.jpg" alt="" /> <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-70" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CAPHILLHOUSING-186-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="Ashwin Warrior enters the Capitol Hill Housing offices on 12th Ave." />[/scroller]', 'Capitol Hill Housing Resident Services', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '23-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-07-09 20:44:01', '2018-07-09 20:44:01', '', 23, 'http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/23-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

He contracted fellow designer, Kenzie Nicholson, and I to execute the brand design. Kenzie and I collaboratively envisioned a brand identity; developed a handout menu, large format menu and food packaging for CMB’s grand opening.\r\n<h3>Project Challenges &amp; Goals</h3>\r\nCheese Meats Bread is an international take on an american classic—the grilled cheese sandwich. Mr. Chung planned to open in the Uwajimaya Village marketplace in the International District.\r\n<h3>Design Strategy</h3>\r\nDuring the research phase Kenzie and I talked largely about how to add an international flare to an American classic without having the brand be offensive or too intrusive for a largely international audience.\r\n<h3>Design Solution</h3>\r\nKenzie and I worked collaboratively throughout the project brainstorming, concept development, and refinement phases. When executing the final deliverables, kenzie created the typographic pattern and packaging design, while I focused on the large format menu board, small take-out menu, and brand identity style guide.\r\n\r\n[image_block][scroller]<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-185" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CMB_style-guide_8.5x11.jpg" alt="" /><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-188" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CMB-menu_6x11.jpg" alt="" /><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-187" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CMB_menu-board_6x4ft_opt-2.jpg" alt="" />[/scroller]\r\n<h4>Brand style guide</h4>\r\n<h4>6x11 in. takeout menu</h4>\r\n<h4>6x4 ft. menu board</h4>\r\n[/image_block]\r\n<h3>Design Process</h3>\r\nWhile brainstorming and exploring concepts, Kenzie and I provided the client with numerous concepts, each of which approached the CMB brand from a unique lens. Upon listening more closely to general feedback from others and the client’s reaction to our presentation, they liked the variety of font selections we provided, but overall they gravitated towards more simpler fonts and cleaner illustrations. We decided on a typographic solution that used a simple logo mark and a typographic pattern as the primary brand elements, with a gooey yellow accent color—<em>Yumm!</em>\r\n<h3>Project Impact</h3>\r\nWe successfully delivered the brand identity packet to the client on schedule and within our budget. Afterwards, I maintained a positive relationship with the client and both design colleagues.

We partnered with the Capitol Hill Arts District (CH Arts District) to design an awareness campaign that coincided with their new website.\r\n<h3>Project Challenges &amp; Goals</h3>\r\nAccording to a recent neighborhood survey, the majority of residents were unaware that Capitol Hill Arts District exists. It was the first neighborhood to be named as part of the Arts &amp; Cultural Districts program by the Seattle City Government (2014). CH Arts District launched their new website in 2017 to elevate its presence. My team’s primary goal was to build off the visual tone established on their website and to increase local community’s awareness of the CH Arts District.\r\n\r\nAnother key challenge for this design assignment was to manage, plan, and coordinate a collaborative design with a team. As the Design Team Lead, I worked closely with Alicia and Ivy to delegate and deliver to our client a comprehensive collateral design and marketing plan.\r\n<h3>Design Strategy</h3>\r\nOur team collaboratively wrote and developed an original marketing campaign. We focused on the environmental and neighborhood aspect of the CH Arts District by designing the marketing collateral as elements of a wayfinding system—to compliment pre-existing brand elements.\r\n\r\nFor example, CH Arts District recently installed new road signs that include their logo on the District perimeter. This improved drivers’ awareness of the Arts District brand and geographic location. We capitalize on their approach buy advertising the large format posters along the perimeter. This expanded the wayfinding signage for pedestrians and increase people’s perception of the CH Arts District physical boundary.\r\n\r\nInside of the CH Arts District, we empowered community partners to facilitate the neighborhood brand. We distributed small format postcards and stickers to community partners and asked them to display and sell them within their business.\r\n\r\nDigital assets, like neighborhood photographs and Facebook cover photos, expanded the CH Arts District presence online. Additionally, the hashtags #NowEntering and #CapitolHillArtsDistrict were applied to the collateral to track the conversation online.\r\n<h3>Design Solution</h3>\r\nThe Capitol Hill Arts District requested that we deliver to them each the following:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>11x17 in. poster design</li>\r\n 	<li>6x4 in. postcard design</li>\r\n 	<li>4x4 in. round sticker</li>\r\n 	<li>Facebook cover photo</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n[scroller bg-color="white"]<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-224" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_poster-mockup-side-by-side.jpg" alt="" /><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-225" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_poster-telephone-pole-01.jpg" alt="" /><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-226" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_poster-telephone-pole-02.jpg" alt="" />[/scroller]\r\n\r\n<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-220" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/Capitol-Hill-Arts-District-social-media-mockup.jpg" alt="" />\r\n<h3>Design Process</h3>\r\nAs the Design Team Lead, it was my responsibility to understand the scope of work to be done, coordinate a schedule between the designers and our client, delegate tasks to each team member, and maintain a positive focus on the project goals and deliverables.\r\n\r\nThe design process included reviewing existing collateral and advertisements, and brainstorming ways to expand up the existing wayfinding signage. Utilizing over 50 photos of public artworks and murals within the Arts district, our team developed initial sketches and defined our concept. Next, we developed the postcard and poster content and produced a series of layouts and sticker designs. The photographs were also used to create social media cover photos. We presented refined concepts to the client for final design edits and then approval.\r\n\r\nThe project scope also included researching of local printers and advertisement companies, coordinating and securing price estimates for printing the collateral and posting flyers around Capitol Hill. Lastly, we presented our marketing campaign design to the Arts District Steering Committee.\r\n<h3>Project Impact</h3>\r\nOur team presented the campaign to the Arts District Steering Committee and recommended a course of action for marketing the CH Arts District. The committee response was overwhelmingly positive.\r\n\r\nThey appreciate the versatility of the design system we made. The text content was minimal and remained consistent across the collateral. The CH Arts District logo was prominently featured, as they requested; while the interchangeable background photos of CH Arts District murals highlighted the local community. The interchangeable backgrounds empowered the committee to swap out photographs with other options we provided. We even proposed to source background photos from district partners and community members to delivered more community value. This was a unique approach to the and CH Arts District committee appreciated the variety and adaptability we provided them.\r\n\r\nThe marketing collateral served as advertisements and aided wayfinding. The large format posters were put along the perimeter of the district to identify its boundary, while personal collateral items were used inside partner locations. The collateral did a solid job notifying people they were entering a new city neighborhood and complemented existing CH Arts District brand signage.\r\n\r\nPostcards and stickers provided and interact marketing tactic that improved peoples perception and engagement with the CH Arts District. In addition, the content was focused and clearly promoted shared art and cultural values. By diversifying the type of collateral and the locations they were marketed, it allowed more audience touch points to increase the campaigns impact.\r\n\r\nTo our excitement, many businesses endorsed our efforts to market the CH Arts District. They liked having the responsibility as a community partner to facilitate the neighborhood’s brand.

(289, 1, '2018-07-09 23:53:01', '2018-07-09 23:53:01', 'Capitol Hill Housing (CHH) is a public corporation organized by the City of Seattle. Their mission is to build vibrant and engaged communities through affordable housing and community development. In total, CHH manages approximately 50 properties, each with eligibility requirements ranging from low-income, elderly, disabled, veteran and other eligibility restricted units.\n<h3>Background</h3>Capitol Hill Housing Resident Service department employs Resident Service Coordinators (RSC) to inform, coordinate and provide resources to its diverse residents. The RSC primarily communicate with residents through information sheets, advertisements on community boards, door-to-door tactics, community, and building events and direct one-on-one contact. They serve as the central resource for all residents living in CHH properties, providing a range of services including general questions, hosting community events and coordinating need-based services such as rental assistance, live-in health care and transportation services to name a few.\n<h3>Project Challenges &amp; Goals</h3>According to CHH resident surveys, less than half the residents were aware that CHH provided individualized support through its Resident Services Program. Additionally, the RSC relied heavily on Microsoft word, so it became important to create a template system any RSC could use on any type of computer. As such, the project goals were identified as follows:\n<ul>\n 	<li>Inform residents about RSC and increase awareness of the many services available</li>\n 	<li>Simplify the layout and be consistent with the CHH brand</li>\n 	<li>Improve the collateral functionality and usability for RSC</li>\n 	<li>Improve and increase the visual accessibility for CHH’s diverse residents</li>\n 	<li>Improve and increase the trust between resident and RSC in individual communities</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Design Strategy</h3>To achieve these goals, I brainstormed the visual design by assessing technical concerns, researching the methods in which RSC communicate with residents, and reviewed the overall brand image and messaging of CHH. To increase overall brand awareness, I set forth to develop a template system that is unique for individual properties, yet consistent with the larger CHH brand. Additionally, my deliverables were simply formatted and easily customizable for the RSC.\n<h3>Design Solutions</h3>The client hired me to provide graphic design services for five collateral items most utilized by the RSC. The existing collateral was redesigned to met the aforementioned goals into five unified, brand consistent templates:\n<ul>\n 	<li>Building Welcome Sheets</li>\n 	<li>RSC Persona Sheets</li>\n 	<li>Monthly Events Calendar</li>\n 	<li>Event Flyers</li>\n 	<li>Resource One Sheets</li>\n</ul>[image_block]\n<img src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_Resident-Services-poster_11x17-663x1024.jpg" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-49" width="360" height="360" alt="">\n<h4>Resident Services Poster</h4>In addition to the five collateral templates, I designed a large format poster to advertise CHH Resident Services. It primarily informs residents of the services available to them. We proposed to mount these posters on community boards in public building spaces, around the building property and within CHH offices. This poster design acts as the outward, public facing representation of the CHH Resident Services available.\n[/image_block]\n\n[image_block][scroller]<img src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_welcome-sheetgeneral_8.5x11.jpg" class="alignnone wp-image-51 size-full" alt=""><img src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_welcome-sheetJoeyG_8.5x11.jpg" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52" alt=""><img src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tmpl_individual-rsc-768x1024.jpg" class="alignnone wp-image-34 size-large" width="360" height="360" alt=""><img src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/poster_resident-services-e1530318746544-834x1024.jpg" class="alignnone wp-image-32 size-large" width="360" height="360" alt="">[/scroller]\n<h4>Building Welcome and RSC Persona Sheets</h4><span style="font-weight: 400">Upon move in, residents receive a packet which includes the building welcome and RSC persona sheets.

The RSC persona sheet introduces the specific RS Coordinator supporting the residents’ property. Both these documents are intended to welcome residents and provide them essential resources, contact information, and other important details about CHH and RSC.</span>\n[/image_block]\n\n[image_block][scroller]<img src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE-calendar_11x8.5.jpg" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-53" alt=""><img src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tmpl_residence-calendar-e1530319018147-1024x803.jpg" class="alignnone wp-image-35 size-large" width="360" height="360" alt="">[/scroller]\n<h4>Monthly Events Calendar</h4>Monthly calendars specific to each property highlight upcoming community events. They are available online, by email and posted in community spaces. After creating a 2018-19 monthly calendar template with updated styles, I added additional content to the footer, for each RSC and building property. This allows the RSC to put their contact information and specific building information on the calendars for residents to easily reference.\n[/image_block]\n\n[image_block][scroller]<img src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_event-poster_8.5x11.jpg" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48" alt=""><img src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/BLANK_event-flyer_x2_5.5x8.5-1024x791.jpg" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-47" width="360" height="360" alt=""><img src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tmpl_event-flyers-e1530319332673-797x1024.jpg" class="alignnone wp-image-33 size-large" width="360" height="360" alt="">[/scroller]\n<h4>Event Flyers</h4>Event flyers posted in community spaces advertise a variety of events and workshops. For maximum ease of use and flexibility, I designed a variable sidebar layout for things like recurrent dates and event sign-ups. RSCs can choose between having a single event date or multiple recurring events, both, or neither.\n\nAdditionally, there is an option for a sign-up content block with a variable height, allowing for maximum customization. I also created a half-sheet event template that reduces event information to its hook, a primary message and call to action, for use by the RSC as handouts for local, building specific events.\n[/image_block]\n\n[image_block][scroller]<img src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_resource-one-sheet_8.5x11-791x1024.jpg" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-50" width="360" height="360" alt=""><img src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tmpl_resource-one-sheet-e1530319531779-819x1024.jpg" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-36" width="360" height="360" alt="">[/scroller]\n<h4>Resource One Sheets</h4>These templates list all relevant contact information for each resource category. I created a typographic system and grid layout that adapts to each collateral template. The system I conceived maintains the appropriate balance between text legibility and readability. This one sheet example is the simplest form of typography and grid layout utilized across every template.\n[/image_block]\n<h3>Design Process</h3>The challenges and client\'s goals were kept at the forefront of my process while designing the collateral. During each step of the project, the following were considered: consistency; accessibility; and usability.\n<h4>Consistency</h4>Consistency affects people’s awareness and trust of a brand. If residents aren’t clear what the RSC provide and who they are in relation to CHH, then they are likely to have less faith in the services provided. I directly addressed this issue through a systematically implemented visual design. Through use of typography, white space, graphic elements and color, I achieved overall visual consistency between all collateral templates.\n<h4>Accessibility</h4>The visual design compliments the content strategy and does not detract from it. We simplified the text and used language understood by a general audience. I also utilized a relatively large font size to improve legibility and tested the color contrast, to ensure residents with visual impairments could view the content.\n<h4>Usability</h4>To provide maximum ease of use for the RSC, who may not have a background in design or layout programs, I chose Adobe InDesign to make the templates. The Adobe InDesign has excellent interface with Adobe Acrobat, a program used by the majority of CHH employees. This resulted in great ease of use for the RSC, allowing for editable content while maintaining overall brand consistency.\n<h3>Project Results</h3>The overall response from the Client, CHH employees, Resident Service Coordinators and residents was overwhelmingly positive. The visual design and functionality of my project deliverables exceeded their expectations.

(290, 1, '2018-07-09 23:56:56', '2018-07-09 23:56:56', 'Capitol Hill Housing (CHH) is a public corporation organized by the City of Seattle. Their mission is to build vibrant and engaged communities through affordable housing and community development. In total, CHH manages approximately 50 properties, each with eligibility requirements ranging from low-income, elderly, disabled, veteran and other eligibility restricted units.\n<h3>Background</h3>Capitol Hill Housing Resident Service department employs Resident Service Coordinators (RSC) to inform, coordinate and provide resources to its diverse residents. The RSC primarily communicate with residents through information sheets, advertisements on community boards, door-to-door tactics, community, and building events and direct one-on-one contact. They serve as the central resource for all residents living in CHH properties, providing a range of services including general questions, hosting community events and coordinating need-based services such as rental assistance, live-in health care and transportation services to name a few.\n<h3>Project Challenges &amp; Goals</h3>According to CHH resident surveys, less than half the residents were aware that CHH provided individualized support through its Resident Services Program. Additionally, the RSC relied heavily on Microsoft word, so it became important to create a template system any RSC could use on any type of computer. As such, the project goals were identified as follows:\n<ul>\n 	<li>Inform residents about RSC and increase awareness of the many services available</li>\n 	<li>Simplify the layout and be consistent with the CHH brand</li>\n 	<li>Improve the collateral functionality and usability for RSC</li>\n 	<li>Improve and increase the visual accessibility for CHH’s diverse residents</li>\n 	<li>Improve and increase the trust between resident and RSC in individual communities</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Design Strategy</h3>To achieve these goals, I brainstormed the visual design by assessing technical concerns, researching the methods in which RSC communicate with residents, and reviewed the overall brand image and messaging of CHH. To increase overall brand awareness, I set forth to develop a template system that is unique for individual properties, yet consistent with the larger CHH brand. Additionally, my deliverables were simply formatted and easily customizable for the RSC.\n<h3>Design Solutions</h3>The client hired me to provide graphic design services for five collateral items most utilized by the RSC. The existing collateral was redesigned to met the aforementioned goals into five unified, brand consistent templates:\n<ul>\n 	<li>Building Welcome Sheets</li>\n 	<li>RSC Persona Sheets</li>\n 	<li>Monthly Events Calendar</li>\n 	<li>Event Flyers</li>\n 	<li>Resource One Sheets</li>\n</ul>[image_block]\n<img src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_Resident-Services-poster_11x17-663x1024.jpg" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-49" width="360" height="360" alt="">\n<h4>Resident Services Poster</h4>In addition to the five collateral templates, I designed a large format poster to advertise CHH Resident Services. It primarily informs residents of the services available to them. We proposed to mount these posters on community boards in public building spaces, around the building property and within CHH offices. This poster design acts as the outward, public facing representation of the CHH Resident Services available.\n[/image_block]\n\n[image_block][scroller]<img src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_welcome-sheetgeneral_8.5x11.jpg" class="alignnone wp-image-51 size-full" alt=""><img src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_welcome-sheetJoeyG_8.5x11.jpg" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52" alt=""><img src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tmpl_individual-rsc-768x1024.jpg" class="alignnone wp-image-34 size-large" width="360" height="360" alt=""><img src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/poster_resident-services-e1530318746544-834x1024.jpg" class="alignnone wp-image-32 size-large" width="360" height="360" alt="">[/scroller]\n<h4>Building Welcome and RSC Persona Sheets</h4><span style="font-weight: 400">Upon move in, residents receive a packet which includes the building welcome and RSC persona sheets. The building welcome sheet informs residents about CHH and resources available through the Resident Services program. The RSC persona sheet introduces the specific RS Coordinator supporting the residents’ property. Both these documents are intended to welcome residents and provide them essential resources, contact information, and other important details about CHH and RSC.</span>\n[/image_block]\n\n[image_block][scroller]<img src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE-calendar_11x8.5.jpg" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-53" alt=""><img src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tmpl_residence-calendar-e1530319018147-1024x803.jpg" class="alignnone wp-image-35 size-large" width="360" height="360" alt="">[/scroller]\n<h4>Monthly Events Calendar</h4>Monthly calendars specific to each property highlight upcoming community events. They are available online, by email and posted in community spaces. After creating a 2018-19 monthly calendar template with updated styles, I added additional content to the footer, for each RSC and building property. This allows the RSC to put their contact information and specific building information on the calendars for residents to easily reference.\n[/image_block]\n\n[image_block][scroller]<img src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_event-poster_8.5x11.jpg" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48" alt=""><img src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/BLANK_event-flyer_x2_5.5x8.5-1024x791.jpg" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-47" width="360" height="360" alt=""><img src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tmpl_event-flyers-e1530319332673-797x1024.jpg" class="alignnone wp-image-33 size-large" width="360" height="360" alt="">[/scroller]\n<h4>Event Flyers</h4>Event flyers posted in community spaces advertise a variety of events and workshops. For maximum ease of use and flexibility, I designed a variable sidebar layout for things like recurrent dates and event sign-ups. RSCs can choose between having a single event date or multiple recurring events, both, or neither.\n\nAdditionally, there is an option for a sign-up content block with a variable height, allowing for maximum customization. I also created a half-sheet event template that reduces event information to its hook, a primary message and call to action, for use by the RSC as handouts for local, building specific events.\n[/image_block]\n\n[image_block][scroller]<img src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_resource-one-sheet_8.5x11-791x1024.jpg" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-50" width="360" height="360" alt=""><img src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tmpl_resource-one-sheet-e1530319531779-819x1024.jpg" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-36" width="360" height="360" alt="">[/scroller]\n<h4>Resource One Sheets</h4>These templates list all relevant contact information for each resource category. I created a typographic system and grid layout that adapts to each collateral template. The system I conceived maintains the appropriate balance between text legibility and readability. This one sheet example is the simplest form of typography and grid layout utilized across every template.\n[/image_block]\n<h3>Design Process</h3>The challenges and client\'s goals were kept at the forefront of my process while designing the collateral. During each step of the project, the following were considered: consistency; accessibility; and usability.\n<h4>Consistency</h4>Consistency affects people’s awareness and trust of a brand. If residents aren’t clear what the RSC provide and who they are in relation to CHH, then they are likely to have less faith in the services provided. I directly addressed this issue through a systematically implemented visual design. Through use of typography, white space, graphic elements and color, I achieved overall visual consistency between all collateral templates.\n<h4>Accessibility</h4>The visual design compliments the content strategy and does not detract from it. We simplified the text and used language understood by a general audience. I also utilized a relatively large font size to improve legibility and tested the color contrast, to ensure residents with visual impairments could view the content.\n<h4>Usability</h4>To provide maximum ease of use for the RSC, who may not have a background in design or layout programs, I chose Adobe InDesign to make the templates. The Adobe InDesign has excellent interface with Adobe Acrobat, a program used by the majority of CHH employees. This resulted in great ease of use for the RSC, allowing for editable content while maintaining overall brand consistency.\n<h3>Project Results</h3>The overall response from the Client, CHH employees, Resident Service Coordinators and residents was overwhelmingly positive. The visual design and functionality of my project deliverables exceeded their expectations. In fact, after using the new templates, several RSC requested more variations for the event flyers, resulting in additional project work.\n\nWhile redesigning the RSC collateral, I created a visual design inspired by the existing CHH brand. It maintained the familiarity of the old styles, while drastically improving RSC brand accessibility, usability, and consistency. Our focus on content strategy, language and visual harmony allowed the collateral to accommodate the diverse audiences with propriety and appeal.\n\n[scroller]\n<img src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/IMG_3094_small.jpg" class="alignnone wp-image-71 size-full" alt="Capitol Hill Housing community event"><img src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/IMG_2666-768x1024.jpg" class="alignnone wp-image-90 size-large" width="360" height="360" alt=""><img src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/IMG_2499-1024x768.jpg" class="alignnone wp-image-89 size-large" width="360" height="360" alt=""><img src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CAPHILLHOUSING-186-1-1024x683.jpg" class="alignnone wp-image-70 size-large" width="360" height="360" alt="Ashwin Warrior enters the Capitol Hill Housing offices on 12th Ave.">[/scroller]', 'Capitol Hill Housing Resident Services', 'The Capitol Hill Housing Resident Services department needed some brand collateral redesign, in response to many residents indicating they are unaware of Resident Services Coordinators and the resources they provide.', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '23-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-07-09 23:56:56', '2018-07-09 23:56:56', '', 23, 'http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/23-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0) ;

(294, 1, '2018-07-10 01:33:25', '2018-07-10 01:33:25', '<h3>Background</h3>For a service learning assignment, I formed a design team with colleagues, Alicia Smith and Ivy Ye. We partnered with the Capitol Hill Arts District (CH Arts District) to design an awareness campaign that coincided with their new website.\n<h3>Project Challenges &amp; Goals</h3>According to a recent neighborhood survey, the majority of residents were unaware that Capitol Hill Arts District exists. It was the first neighborhood to be named as part of the Arts &amp; Cultural Districts program by the Seattle City Government (2014). CH Arts District launched their new website in 2017 to elevate its presence. My team’s primary goal was to build off the visual tone established on their website and to increase local community’s awareness of the CH Arts District.\n\nAnother key challenge for this design assignment was to manage, plan, and coordinate a collaborative design with a team. As the Design Team Lead, I worked closely with Alicia and Ivy to delegate and deliver to our client a comprehensive collateral design and marketing plan.\n<h3>Design Strategy</h3>Our team collaboratively wrote and developed an original marketing campaign. We focused on the environmental and neighborhood aspect of the CH Arts District by designing the marketing collateral as elements of a wayfinding system—to compliment pre-existing brand elements.\n\nFor example, CH Arts District recently installed new road signs that include their logo on the District perimeter. This improved drivers’ awareness of the Arts District brand and geographic location. We capitalize on their approach buy advertising the large format posters along the perimeter. This expanded the wayfinding signage for pedestrians and increase people’s perception of the CH Arts District physical boundary.\n\nInside of the CH Arts District, we empowered community partners to facilitate the neighborhood brand. We distributed small format postcards and stickers to community partners and asked them to display and sell them within their business.\n\nDigital assets, like neighborhood photographs and Facebook cover photos, expanded the CH Arts District presence online. Additionally, the hashtags #NowEntering and #CapitolHillArtsDistrict were applied to the collateral to track the conversation online.\n<h3>Design Solution</h3>The Capitol Hill Arts District requested that we deliver to them each the following:\n<ul>\n 	<li>11x17 in. poster design</li>\n 	<li>6x4 in. postcard design</li>\n 	<li>4x4 in. round sticker</li>\n 	<li>Facebook cover photo</li>\n</ul>[scroller bg-color="white"]<img src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_poster-mockup-side-by-side.jpg" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-224" alt=""><img src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_poster-telephone-pole-01.jpg" class="alignnone wp-image-225 size-full" alt=""><img src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_poster-telephone-pole-02.jpg" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-226" alt="">[/scroller]\n\n<img src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/Capitol-Hill-Arts-District-social-media-mockup.jpg" class="alignnone wp-image-220 size-full" alt="">\n<h3>Design Process</h3>As the Design Team Lead, it was my responsibility to understand the scope of work to be done, coordinate a schedule between the designers and our client, delegate tasks to each team member, and maintain a positive focus on the project goals and deliverables.\n\nThe design process included reviewing existing collateral and advertisements, and brainstorming ways to expand up the existing wayfinding signage. Utilizing over 50 photos of public artworks and murals within the Arts district, our team developed initial sketches and defined our concept. Next, we developed the postcard and poster content and produced a series of layouts and sticker designs. The photographs were also used to create social media cover photos. We presented refined concepts to the client for final design edits and then approval.\n\nThe project scope also included researching of local printers and advertisement companies, coordinating and securing price estimates for printing the collateral and posting flyers around Capitol Hill. Lastly, we presented our marketing campaign design to the Arts District Steering Committee.\n<h3>Project Impact</h3>Our team presented the campaign to the Arts District Steering Committee and recommended a course of action for marketing the CH Arts District. The committee response was overwhelmingly positive.\n\nThey appreciate the versatility of the design system we made. The text content was minimal and remained consistent across the collateral. The CH Arts District logo was prominently featured, as they requested; while the interchangeable background photos of CH Arts District murals highlighted the local community. The interchangeable backgrounds empowered the committee to swap out photographs with other options we provided. We even proposed to source background photos from district partners and community members to delivered more community value. This was a unique approach to the and CH Arts District committee appreciated the variety and adaptability we provided them.\n\nThe marketing collateral served as advertisements and aided wayfinding. The large format posters were put along the perimeter of the district to identify its boundary, while personal collateral items were used inside partner locations. The collateral did a solid job notifying people they were entering a new city neighborhood and complemented existing CH Arts District brand signage.\n\nPostcards and stickers provided and interact marketing tactic that improved peoples perception and engagement with the CH Arts District. In addition, the content was focused and clearly promoted shared art and cultural values. By diversifying the type of collateral and the locations they were marketed, it allowed more audience touch points to increase the campaigns impact.\n\nTo our excitement, many businesses endorsed our efforts to market the CH Arts District. They liked having the responsibility as a community partner to facilitate the neighborhood’s brand. Some community partners even opted to put the poster advertisement in their window.\n\nThe committee accepted our proposed marketing plan and the posters, stickers, and postcards were successfully promoted in the Capitol Hill Arts District throughout the summer of 2017.\n<h3>Sources</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li><a href="http://capitolhillarts.org/now-entering/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Capitol Hill Arts, Now Entering campaign page</a></li>\n 	<li><a href="https://segd.org/what-wayfinding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">What is Wayfinding? — Seattle Environmental Graphic Design</a></li>\n</ul>[column_wrap count="2"]\n\n[column]\n<img src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_postcards-front-01.jpg" class="alignnone wp-image-223 size-full" alt="">\n[/column]\n\n[column]\n\n<img src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_postcards-back.jpg" class="alignnone wp-image-222 size-full" height="2824" alt="" width="2812">\n\n[/column]\n\n[/column_wrap]\n\n[column_wrap count="9"]\n[column]\n<img src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-dark-150x150.jpg" class="alignnone wp-image-234 size-thumbnail" width="150" height="150" alt="">\n[/column][column]\n<img src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-1-red-150x150.jpg" class="alignnone wp-image-227 size-thumbnail" width="135" height="135" alt="">\n[/column][column]\n<img src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-2-orange-150x150.jpg" class="alignnone wp-image-228 size-thumbnail" width="135" height="135" alt="">\n[/column][column]\n<img src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-3-yellow-150x150.jpg" class="alignnone wp-image-229 size-thumbnail" width="135" height="135" alt="">\n[/column][column]\n<img src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-4-green-150x150.jpg" class="alignnone wp-image-230 size-thumbnail" width="135" height="135" alt="">\n[/column][column]\n<img src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-5-teal-150x150.jpg" class="alignnone wp-image-231 size-thumbnail" width="150" height="150" alt="">\n[/column][column]\n<img src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-6-blue-150x150.jpg" class="alignnone wp-image-232 size-thumbnail" width="135" height="135" alt="">\n[/column][column]\n<img src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-7-purple-150x150.jpg" class="alignnone wp-image-233 size-thumbnail" width="135" height="135" alt="">\n[/column][column]\n<img src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-light-150x150.jpg" class="alignnone wp-image-235 size-thumbnail" width="135" height="135" alt="">\n[/column]\n[/column_wrap]', 'Capitol Hill Arts District', 'As Design Team Lead, some colleagues and I partnered with the Capitol Hill Arts District to design an awareness campaign that coincided with their new website.', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '217-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-07-10 01:33:25', '2018-07-10 01:33:25', '', 217, 'http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/217-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

(303, 1, '2018-07-10 08:02:49', '2018-07-10 08:02:49', 'Capitol Hill Housing (CHH) is a public corporation organized by the City of Seattle. Their mission is to build vibrant and engaged communities through affordable housing and community development. In total, CHH manages approximately 50 properties, each with eligibility requirements ranging from low-income, elderly, disabled, veteran and other eligibility restricted units.\r\n<h3>Background</h3>\r\nCapitol Hill Housing Resident Service department employs Resident Service Coordinators (RSC) to inform, coordinate and provide resources to its diverse residents. The RSC primarily communicate with residents through information sheets, advertisements on community boards, door-to-door tactics, community, and building events and direct one-on-one contact. They serve as the central resource for all residents living in CHH properties, providing a range of services including general questions, hosting community events and coordinating need-based services such as rental assistance, live-in health care and transportation services to name a few.\r\n<h3>Project Challenges &amp; Goals</h3>\r\nAccording to CHH resident surveys, less than half the residents were aware that CHH provided individualized support through its Resident Services Program. Additionally, the RSC relied heavily on Microsoft word, so it became important to create a template system any RSC could use on any type of computer. As such, the project goals were identified as follows:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Inform residents about RSC and increase awareness of the many services available</li>\r\n 	<li>Simplify the layout and be consistent with the CHH brand</li>\r\n 	<li>Improve the collateral functionality and usability for RSC</li>\r\n 	<li>Improve and increase the visual accessibility for CHH’s diverse residents</li>\r\n 	<li>Improve and increase the trust between resident and RSC in individual communities</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Design Strategy</h3>\r\nTo achieve these goals, I brainstormed the visual design by assessing technical concerns, researching the methods in which RSC communicate with residents, and reviewed the overall brand image and messaging of CHH. To increase overall brand awareness, I set forth to develop a template system that is unique for individual properties, yet consistent with the larger CHH brand. Additionally, my deliverables were simply formatted and easily customizable for the RSC.\r\n<h3>Design Solutions</h3>\r\nThe client hired me to provide graphic design services for five collateral items most utilized by the RSC. The existing collateral was redesigned to met the aforementioned goals into five unified, brand consistent templates:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Building Welcome Sheets</li>\r\n 	<li>RSC Persona Sheets</li>\r\n 	<li>Monthly Events Calendar</li>\r\n 	<li>Event Flyers</li>\r\n 	<li>Resource One Sheets</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n[image_block]\r\n<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-49" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_Resident-Services-poster_11x17-663x1024.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="360" />\r\n<h4>Resident Services Poster</h4>\r\nIn addition to the five collateral templates, I designed a large format poster to advertise CHH Resident Services. It primarily informs residents of the services available to them. We proposed to mount these posters on community boards in public building spaces, around the building property and within CHH offices. This poster design acts as the outward, public facing representation of the CHH Resident Services available.\r\n[/image_block]\r\n\r\n[image_block][scroller]<img class="alignnone wp-image-51 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_welcome-sheetgeneral_8.5x11.jpg" alt="" /><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_welcome-sheetJoeyG_8.5x11.jpg" alt="" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-34 size-large" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tmpl_individual-rsc-768x1024.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="360" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-32 size-large" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/poster_resident-services-e1530318746544-834x1024.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="360" />[/scroller]\r\n<h4>Building Welcome and RSC Persona Sheets</h4>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon move in, residents receive a packet which includes the building welcome and RSC persona sheets. The building welcome sheet informs residents about CHH and resources available through the Resident Services program. The RSC persona sheet introduces the specific RS Coordinator supporting the residents’ property. Both these documents are intended to welcome residents and provide them essential resources, contact information, and other important details about CHH and RSC.</span>\r\n[/image_block]\r\n\r\n[image_block][scroller]<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-53" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE-calendar_11x8.5.jpg" alt="" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-35 size-large" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tmpl_residence-calendar-e1530319018147-1024x803.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="360" />[/scroller]\r\n<h4>Monthly Events Calendar</h4>\r\nMonthly calendars specific to each property highlight upcoming community events. They are available online, by email and posted in community spaces. After creating a 2018-19 monthly calendar template with updated styles, I added additional content to the footer, for each RSC and building property.

I created a typographic system and grid layout that adapts to each collateral template. The system I conceived maintains the appropriate balance between text legibility and readability. This one sheet example is the simplest form of typography and grid layout utilized across every template.\r\n[/image_block]\r\n<h3>Design Process</h3>\r\nThe challenges and client\'s goals were kept at the forefront of my process while designing the collateral. During each step of the project, the following were considered: consistency; accessibility; and usability.\r\n<h4>Consistency</h4>\r\nConsistency affects people’s awareness and trust of a brand. If residents aren’t clear what the RSC provide and who they are in relation to CHH, then they are likely to have less faith in the services provided. I directly addressed this issue through a systematically implemented visual design. Through use of typography, white space, graphic elements and color, I achieved overall visual consistency between all collateral templates.\r\n<h4>Accessibility</h4>\r\nThe visual design compliments the content strategy and does not detract from it. We simplified the text and used language understood by a general audience. I also utilized a relatively large font size to improve legibility and tested the color contrast, to ensure residents with visual impairments could view the content.\r\n<h4>Usability</h4>\r\nTo provide maximum ease of use for the RSC, who may not have a background in design or layout programs, I chose Adobe InDesign to make the templates. The Adobe InDesign has excellent interface with Adobe Acrobat, a program used by the majority of CHH employees. This resulted in great ease of use for the RSC, allowing for editable content while maintaining overall brand consistency.\r\n<h3>Project Results</h3>\r\nThe overall response from the Client, CHH employees, Resident Service Coordinators and residents was overwhelmingly positive. The visual design and functionality of my project deliverables exceeded their expectations. In fact, after using the new templates, several RSC requested more variations for the event flyers, resulting in additional project work.\r\n\r\nWhile redesigning the RSC collateral, I created a visual design inspired by the existing CHH brand. It maintained the familiarity of the old styles, while drastically improving RSC brand accessibility, usability, and consistency. Our focus on content strategy, language and visual harmony allowed the collateral to accommodate the diverse audiences with propriety and appeal.\r\n\r\n[scroller]\r\n<img class="alignnone wp-image-71 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/IMG_3094_small.jpg" alt="Capitol Hill Housing community event" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-90 size-large" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/IMG_2666-768x1024.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="360" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-89 size-large" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/IMG_2499-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="360" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-70 size-large" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CAPHILLHOUSING-186-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="Ashwin Warrior enters the Capitol Hill Housing offices on 12th Ave." width="360" height="360" />[/scroller]', 'Capitol Hill Housing Resident Services', 'The Capitol Hill Housing Resident Services department needed some brand collateral redesign, in response to many residents indicating they are unaware of Resident Services Coordinators and the resources they provide.', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '23-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-07-10 08:02:49', '2018-07-10 08:02:49', '', 23, 'http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/23-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0) ;

(304, 1, '2018-07-10 08:05:23', '2018-07-10 08:05:23', 'Capitol Hill Housing (CHH) is a public corporation organized by the City of Seattle. Their mission is to build vibrant and engaged communities through affordable housing and community development. In total, CHH manages approximately 50 properties, each with eligibility requirements ranging from low-income, elderly, disabled, veteran and other eligibility restricted units.\r\n<h3>Background</h3>\r\nCapitol Hill Housing Resident Service department employs Resident Service Coordinators (RSC) to inform, coordinate and provide resources to its diverse residents. The RSC primarily communicate with residents through information sheets, advertisements on community boards, door-to-door tactics, community, and building events and direct one-on-one contact. They serve as the central resource for all residents living in CHH properties, providing a range of services including general questions, hosting community events and coordinating need-based services such as rental assistance, live-in health care and transportation services to name a few.\r\n<h3>Project Challenges &amp; Goals</h3>\r\nAccording to CHH resident surveys, less than half the residents were aware that CHH provided individualized support through its Resident Services Program. Additionally, the RSC relied heavily on Microsoft word, so it became important to create a template system any RSC could use on any type of computer. As such, the project goals were identified as follows:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Inform residents about RSC and increase awareness of the many services available</li>\r\n 	<li>Simplify the layout and be consistent with the CHH brand</li>\r\n 	<li>Improve the collateral functionality and usability for RSC</li>\r\n 	<li>Improve and increase the visual accessibility for CHH’s diverse residents</li>\r\n 	<li>Improve and increase the trust between resident and RSC in individual communities</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Design Strategy</h3>\r\nTo achieve these goals, I brainstormed the visual design by assessing technical concerns, researching the methods in which RSC communicate with residents, and reviewed the overall brand image and messaging of CHH. To increase overall brand awareness, I set forth to develop a template system that is unique for individual properties, yet consistent with the larger CHH brand. Additionally, my deliverables were simply formatted and easily customizable for the RSC.\r\n<h3>Design Solutions</h3>\r\nThe client hired me to provide graphic design services for five collateral items most utilized by the RSC. The existing collateral was redesigned to met the aforementioned goals into five unified, brand consistent templates:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Building Welcome Sheets</li>\r\n 	<li>RSC Persona Sheets</li>\r\n 	<li>Monthly Events Calendar</li>\r\n 	<li>Event Flyers</li>\r\n 	<li>Resource One Sheets</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n[image_block]\r\n<img class="alignnone wp-image-49 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_Resident-Services-poster_11x17.jpg" alt="" width="792" height="1224" />\r\n<h4>Resident Services Poster</h4>\r\nIn addition to the five collateral templates, I designed a large format poster to advertise CHH Resident Services. It primarily informs residents of the services available to them. We proposed to mount these posters on community boards in public building spaces, around the building property and within CHH offices. This poster design acts as the outward, public facing representation of the CHH Resident Services available.\r\n[/image_block]\r\n\r\n[image_block][scroller]<img class="alignnone wp-image-51 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_welcome-sheetgeneral_8.5x11.jpg" alt="" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-52 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_welcome-sheetJoeyG_8.5x11.jpg" alt="" width="612" height="792" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-34 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tmpl_individual-rsc.jpg" alt="" width="2448" height="3264" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-32 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/poster_resident-services-e1530318746544.jpg" alt="" width="2366" height="2904" />[/scroller]\r\n<h4>Building Welcome and RSC Persona Sheets</h4>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon move in, residents receive a packet which includes the building welcome and RSC persona sheets. The building welcome sheet informs residents about CHH and resources available through the Resident Services program. The RSC persona sheet introduces the specific RS Coordinator supporting the residents’ property. Both these documents are intended to welcome residents and provide them essential resources, contact information, and other important details about CHH and RSC.</span>\r\n[/image_block]\r\n\r\n[image_block][scroller]<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-53" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE-calendar_11x8.5.jpg" alt="" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-35 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tmpl_residence-calendar-e1530319018147.jpg" alt="" width="2986" height="2341" />[/scroller]\r\n<h4>Monthly Events Calendar</h4>\r\nMonthly calendars specific to each property highlight upcoming community events.

I excel at composing and formulating information into clear visuals that demonstrate mature application of design theory and practice. With a diverse background in digital and print design, I work with local businesses to develop impact driven collateral including marketing tools, brand identity, templates, website design, presentations and visual strategies.\r\n\r\nMy experience working with a startup, an architecture studio, designing for Seattle businesses, and serving on a 501(c)(3) board as the Design and Marketing Chair, allowed me the opportunity to gain in depth knowledge about the professional and creative sides of design.\r\n<h3>People tell me I am good at</h3>\r\n<h4>Asking Questions</h4>\r\nMy process is driven by curiosity. I address challenges creatively by asking questions first. Afterwards, I thoroughly research target markets, audience demographics, typography and design patterns. At the same time, hand sketching and photographic moodboards compliment my research. This part of my process inspires further conceptual development and helps me understand the variables involved — to properly execute a visual strategy that achieves the project goals.\r\n<h4>Iteration &amp; Variation</h4>\r\nI use an iterative design process to explore many design concepts. Team critiques are an important component to iteration. It opens up dialogue between the design concept and its stakeholders. Brainstorming is another tactic I utilize in my workflow to help teams visualize and orient towards a design concept. These conversations inform my process and serve further conceptual development.\r\n<h4>Organization</h4>\r\nWhether it’s my desk space, a quarterly marketing plan, or comprehensive designs, I maintain an organized workspace and accessible workflow.

We partnered with the Capitol Hill Arts District (CH Arts District) to design an awareness campaign that coincided with their new website.\r\n<h3>Project Challenges &amp; Goals</h3>\r\nAccording to a recent neighborhood survey, the majority of residents were unaware that Capitol Hill Arts District exists. It was the first neighborhood to be named as part of the Arts &amp; Cultural Districts program by the Seattle City Government (2014). CH Arts District launched their new website in 2017 to elevate its presence. My team’s primary goal was to build off the visual tone established on their website and to increase local community’s awareness of the CH Arts District.\r\n\r\nAnother key challenge for this design assignment was to manage, plan, and coordinate a collaborative design with a team. As the Design Team Lead, I worked closely with Alicia and Ivy to delegate and deliver to our client a comprehensive collateral design and marketing plan.\r\n<h3>Design Strategy</h3>\r\nOur team collaboratively wrote and developed an original marketing campaign. We focused on the environmental and neighborhood aspect of the CH Arts District by designing the marketing collateral as elements of a wayfinding system—to compliment pre-existing brand elements.\r\n\r\nFor example, CH Arts District recently installed new road signs that include their logo on the District perimeter. This improved drivers’ awareness of the Arts District brand and geographic location. We capitalize on their approach buy advertising the large format posters along the perimeter. This expanded the wayfinding signage for pedestrians and increase people’s perception of the CH Arts District physical boundary.\r\n\r\nInside of the CH Arts District, we empowered community partners to facilitate the neighborhood brand. We distributed small format postcards and stickers to community partners and asked them to display and sell them within their business.\r\n\r\nDigital assets, like neighborhood photographs and Facebook cover photos, expanded the CH Arts District presence online. Additionally, the hashtags #NowEntering and #CapitolHillArtsDistrict were applied to the collateral to track the conversation online.\r\n<h3>Design Solution</h3>\r\nThe Capitol Hill Arts District requested that we deliver to them each the following:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>11x17 in. poster design</li>\r\n 	<li>6x4 in. postcard design</li>\r\n 	<li>4x4 in. round sticker</li>\r\n 	<li>Facebook cover photo</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n[scroller bg-color="white"]<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-224" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_poster-mockup-side-by-side.jpg" alt="" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-225 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_poster-telephone-pole-01.jpg" alt="" /><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-226" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_poster-telephone-pole-02.jpg" alt="" />[/scroller]\r\n\r\n<img class="alignnone wp-image-220 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/Capitol-Hill-Arts-District-social-media-mockup.jpg" alt="" />\r\n<h3>Design Process</h3>\r\nAs the Design Team Lead, it was my responsibility to understand the scope of work to be done, coordinate a schedule between the designers and our client, delegate tasks to each team member, and maintain a positive focus on the project goals and deliverables.\r\n\r\nThe design process included reviewing existing collateral and advertisements, and brainstorming ways to expand up the existing wayfinding signage. Utilizing over 50 photos of public artworks and murals within the Arts district, our team developed initial sketches and defined our concept. Next, we developed the postcard and poster content and produced a series of layouts and sticker designs. The photographs were also used to create social media cover photos. We presented refined concepts to the client for final design edits and then approval.\r\n\r\nThe project scope also included researching of local printers and advertisement companies, coordinating and securing price estimates for printing the collateral and posting flyers around Capitol Hill. Lastly, we presented our marketing campaign design to the Arts District Steering Committee.\r\n<h3>Project Impact</h3>\r\nOur team presented the campaign to the Arts District Steering Committee and recommended a course of action for marketing the CH Arts District. The committee response was overwhelmingly positive.\r\n\r\nThey appreciate the versatility of the design system we made. The text content was minimal and remained consistent across the collateral. The CH Arts District logo was prominently featured, as they requested; while the interchangeable background photos of CH Arts District murals highlighted the local community. The interchangeable backgrounds empowered the committee to swap out photographs with other options we provided. We even proposed to source background photos from district partners and community members to delivered more community value. This was a unique approach to the and CH Arts District committee appreciated the variety and adaptability we provided them.\r\n\r\nThe marketing collateral served as advertisements and aided wayfinding. The large format posters were put along the perimeter of the district to identify its boundary, while personal collateral items were used inside partner locations. The collateral did a solid job notifying people they were entering a new city neighborhood and complemented existing CH Arts District brand signage.\r\n\r\nPostcards and stickers provided and interact marketing tactic that improved peoples perception and engagement with the CH Arts District. In addition, the content was focused and clearly promoted shared art and cultural values. By diversifying the type of collateral and the locations they were marketed, it allowed more audience touch points to increase the campaigns impact.\r\n\r\nTo our excitement, many businesses endorsed our efforts to market the CH Arts District. They liked having the responsibility as a community partner to facilitate the neighborhood’s brand. Some community partners even opted to put the poster advertisement in their window.\r\n\r\nThe committee accepted our proposed marketing plan and the posters, stickers, and postcards were successfully promoted in the Capitol Hill Arts District throughout the summer of 2017.\r\n<h3>Sources</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><a href="http://capitolhillarts.org/now-entering/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Capitol Hill Arts, Now Entering campaign page</a></li>\r\n 	<li><a href="https://segd.org/what-wayfinding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">What is Wayfinding? — Seattle Environmental Graphic Design</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n[column_wrap count="2"]\r\n\r\n[column]\r\n<img class="alignnone wp-image-223 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_postcards-front-01.jpg" alt="" />\r\n[/column]\r\n\r\n[column]\r\n\r\n<img class="alignnone wp-image-222 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_postcards-back.jpg" alt="" width="2812" height="2824" />\r\n\r\n[/column]\r\n\r\n[/column_wrap]\r\n\r\n[column_wrap count="9"]\r\n[column]\r\n<img class="alignnone wp-image-234 size-thumbnail" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-dark-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />\r\n[/column][column]\r\n<img class="alignnone wp-image-227 size-thumbnail" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-1-red-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="135" height="135" />\r\n[/column][column]\r\n<img class="alignnone wp-image-228 size-thumbnail" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-2-orange-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="135" height="135" />\r\n[/column][column]\r\n<img class="alignnone wp-image-229 size-thumbnail" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-3-yellow-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="135" height="135" />\r\n[/column][column]\r\n<img class="alignnone wp-image-230 size-thumbnail" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-4-green-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="135" height="135" />\r\n[/column][column]\r\n<img class="alignnone wp-image-231 size-thumbnail" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-5-teal-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />\r\n[/column][column]\r\n<img class="alignnone wp-image-232 size-thumbnail" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-6-blue-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="135" height="135" />\r\n[/column][column]\r\n<img class="alignnone wp-image-233 size-thumbnail" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-7-purple-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="135" height="135" />\r\n[/column][column]\r\n<img class="alignnone wp-image-235 size-thumbnail" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-light-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="135" height="135" />\r\n[/column]\r\n[/column_wrap]', 'Capitol Hill Arts District', 'As Design Team Lead, some colleagues and I partnered with the Capitol Hill Arts District to design an awareness campaign that coincided with their new website.', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '217-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-07-10 23:04:56', '2018-07-10 23:04:56', '', 217, 'http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/217-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),
(313, 1, '2018-07-10 23:07:43', '2018-07-10 23:07:43', 'For the Capitol Hill Housing leasing department, I conceptualized, designed and developed a leasing packet for an affordable housing development in the Central District called the Liberty Bank Building. The building is a multi-use apartment complex with entirely low-income eligible units and over 2,500 square feet of commercial space for local businesses. It is currently under construction and scheduled to open February 2019.\r\n<h3>Background</h3>\r\nThe Liberty Bank Building is the result of a collective partnership between Africa Town Central District, Byrd Barr Place, Black Community Impact Alliance, the Capitol Hill Housing Foundation, local community leaders and founders of the Liberty Bank. This historic project aspires to preserve the legacy of <em>the Liberty Bank</em>, "the first Black-owned bank west of the Mississippi, founded as a community response to redlining and disinvestment in Central Seattle" (libertybankbuilding.org).\r\n\r\nHistorically, the City government divested from the Central District. This segregated community became a hub for pan-African and migrant community culture. Today it is experiencing rapid urban development, and as rent increases faster than the existing community members are able to afford, they become displaced from their homes.\r\n\r\nThe Liberty Bank Building is designed to be affordable to everyday people, and aspires to continue to support the community for years to come. We wanted to highlight this legacy, preserve the existing identity of the Central District, and steward in a new generation of community engagement.\r\n<h3>Project Challenges &amp; Goals</h3>\r\nExisting Liberty Bank material, while resourceful, was lengthy and complex, making it impractical for the target audience. A key assignment for this project was to create leasing content that would be understandable and usable for <em>all members</em> of the community—<em>it needed to be accessible</em>.\r\n\r\nThe leasing packet design was heavily influenced by all these factors. The project goals were:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>to clarify the eligibility requirements for affordable housing</li>\r\n 	<li>walk applicants through the leasing process and timeline for the Liberty Bank Building</li>\r\n 	<li>affirmatively market to audiences affected by rapid urbanization in the Central District</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Design Strategy</h3>\r\nThe design needed to be tailored to a broad range of audience segments. The primary audience was individuals and families living in the Central District who qualify for affordable housing. The secondary audience was community members and small businesses, particularly of pan-African decent, affected by rapidly rising rent. The third audience, was public officials, agencies, and organization who work in the housing marketplace.\r\n\r\nTo clarify the eligibility requirements for affordable housing and walk applicants through the leasing process, I neatly organized complex leasing information in a format accessible to a broad audience whom are largely unfamiliar with affordable housing regulation in Seattle, but have a deeply rooted history in the Central District.\r\n<h3>Design Solution</h3>\r\n[scroller bg-color="LightSlateGrey"]\r\n<img class="alignnone wp-image-307 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018-05-04_LBB-leasing-packet-refinements_spread_1.jpg" alt="" width="1275" height="1650" /> <img class="alignnone wp-image-308 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018-05-04_LBB-leasing-packet-refinements_spread_2.jpg" alt="" width="2550" height="1650" /> <img class="alignnone wp-image-309 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018-05-04_LBB-leasing-packet-refinements_spread_3.jpg" alt="" width="2550" height="1650" /> <img class="alignnone wp-image-310 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018-05-04_LBB-leasing-packet-refinements_spread_4.jpg" alt="" width="2550" height="1650" /> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-311" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018-05-04_LBB-leasing-packet-refinements_spread_5.jpg" alt="" />\r\n[/scroller]\r\n\r\nThe Capitol Hill Housing Foundation hired me to deliver a single leasing packet of the following items:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>General building information including amenities, photos, and location map</li>\r\n 	<li>Affordable housing process overview</li>\r\n 	<li>Income requirements for applying</li>\r\n 	<li>A timeline of the project development and leasing process</li>\r\n 	<li>Frequently Asked Questions sheet</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Design Process</h3>\r\nLeasing affordable housing differs from non-subsidized apartments; and the Liberty Bank Building itself poses a unique application process. While focusing on conceptual development with moodboards, typography and color schemes, I worked with the team to categorize, synthesize and tailor content strategically.\r\n\r\nThe visual design is intuitive and simply explains affordable housing, the application process, and eligibility requirements use accessible language. Visual graphs and tables help applicants interactively determine their eligibility, while a four step visual breakdown walks them through the leasing process.\r\n\r\nWe sourced historic photos from the Liberty Bank partners, and composed them with photos of the new Liberty Bank Building. I coordinated with the client to render a more diverse group of people in the building renderings. I was sure to prioritize contact information; and developed a Frequently Asked Questions spread. I also included a timeline of key dates for the project construction and leasing process.\r\n<h3>Project Impact</h3>\r\nThe layout itself is a huge improvement from the single word document the partners began with. Including photos of the historic Central District and current community events, drastically improved the packets relatability. The use of visual motifs, typographic hierarchy and layout, and brand consistency were driving forces behind achieving project goals.\r\n\r\nThe partners responded very positively to the leasing packet design. The project delivered on schedule and within the project budget. Once the Liberty Bank Building partners begin actively marketing, it is anticipated this leasing packet will allow local community members to become more familiar with the affordable housing application process and give them the confidence to inquire about living at the Liberty Bank Building.\r\n\r\nThe Liberty Bank Building partners utilized the leasing packet to affirmatively market to audiences affected by rapid urbanization. They plan to host local events to build community and pass out these leasing packets to residents in need. The visual design compliments their marketing tactics in a way that communicates the history of the Liberty Bank, expresses the future tone of the Liberty Bank Building, and respects the pan-African community in the Central District.\r\n<h3>Sources</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><a href="http://libertybankbuilding.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Liberty Bank Building</a></li>\r\n 	<li><a href="http://www.africatownlandtrust.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Africa Town Land Trust, Central District</a></li>\r\n 	<li><a href="https://byrdbarrplace.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Byrd Barr Place</a></li>\r\n 	<li><a href="http://david-harris-wkj7.squarespace.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black Community Impact Alliance</a></li>\r\n 	<li><a href="https://www.capitolhillhousing.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Capitol Hill Housing Foundation</a></li>\r\n</ul>', 'The Liberty Bank Building', 'For the Capitol Hill Housing leasing department, I conceptualized, designed and developed a leasing packet for an affordable housing development in the Central District called the Liberty Bank Building.', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '160-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-07-10 23:07:43', '2018-07-10 23:07:43', '', 160, 'http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/160-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

(316, 1, '2018-07-11 02:58:40', '2018-07-11 02:58:40', '<h3>Background</h3>\r\nFor a service learning assignment, I formed a design team with several colleagues and we partnered with the Capitol Hill Arts District (CHAD) to design an awareness campaign that coincided with their new website.\r\n<h3>Project Challenges &amp; Goals</h3>\r\nAccording to a neighborhood survey, many residents were unaware that CHAD existed. It was the first neighborhood to be named as part of the Arts &amp; Cultural Districts program by the Seattle City Government in 2014.  CHAD launched their website in 2017 to elevate its presence. My team’s primary goal was to build off the visual tone established on their website and to increase community awareness. Another key challenge for this assignment was to manage, plan, and coordinate a collaborative design with a team. As the Design Lead, I worked closely with the team to delegate and deliver a comprehensive collateral design and marketing plan to our client.\r\n<h3>Design Strategy</h3>\r\nOur team developed a targeted marketing campaign, focusing on the environmental and neighborhood aspects of CHAD.  By designing the collateral materials as elements of a wayfinding system and complimenting pre-existing brand elements, we increased pedestrian and drivers’ perception of CHAD’s physical boundary.\r\n\r\nInside of the CHAD, we empowered community partners to facilitate the neighborhood brand. We distributed small format postcards and stickers to community partners and asked them to display and sell them within their business.  Digital assets, like neighborhood photographs and Facebook cover photos, expanded the CHAD presence online. Additionally, the hashtags #NowEntering and #CapitolHillArtsDistrict were applied to the collateral to track the conversation online.\r\n<h3>Design Solution</h3>\r\nThe Capitol Hill Arts District requested that we deliver each of the following:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>11x17 in. poster design</li>\r\n 	<li>6x4 in. postcard design</li>\r\n 	<li>4x4 in. round sticker</li>\r\n 	<li>Facebook cover photo</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n[scroller bg-color="white"]\r\n<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-224" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_poster-mockup-side-by-side.jpg" alt="" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-225 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_poster-telephone-pole-01.jpg" alt="" /><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-226" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_poster-telephone-pole-02.jpg" alt="" />[/scroller]\r\n\r\n<img class="alignnone wp-image-220 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/Capitol-Hill-Arts-District-social-media-mockup.jpg" alt="" />\r\n<h3>Design Process</h3>\r\nAs the Team Lead, it was my responsibility to understand the scope of work, coordinate a schedule between the designers and our client, delegate tasks to each team member, and maintain a positive focus on the project goals and deliverables.\r\n\r\nThe design process included reviewing existing collateral and advertisements, and brainstorming ways to expand upon the existing wayfinding signage. Utilizing over 50 photos of public artworks and murals within the Arts district, our team developed initial sketches and defined our concept. Next, we developed the postcard and poster content and produced a series of layouts and sticker designs. The photographs were also used to create social media cover photos. We presented refined concepts to the client for final design edits and then approval.  The project scope also included researching of local printers and advertisement companies, coordinating and securing price estimates for printing and posting flyers around Capitol Hill.\r\n<h3>Project Impact</h3>\r\nOur team presented the campaign to the Arts District Steering Committee and recommended a course of action for marketing CHAD. The committee response was overwhelmingly positive.\r\n\r\nThey appreciated the versatility of the design system we made. The text content was minimal and remained consistent across the collateral. The CHAD logo was prominently featured, while the interchangeable background photos of CHAD murals highlighted the local community.  The interchangeable backgrounds empowered the committee to swap out photographs with other options, as well as sourcing background photos from district partners and community members to deliver more community value. This unique, adaptable design approach proved very successful to the client.\r\n\r\nThe marketing collateral served as advertisements and aided wayfinding. The large format posters were put along the perimeter of the district to identify its boundary, while personal collateral items were used inside partner locations. The collateral did a solid job notifying people they were entering a new city neighborhood and complemented existing CHAD brand signage.  The content was focused and clearly promoted shared art and cultural values, which improved people’s awareness and perception of CHAD.\r\n\r\nTo our excitement, many businesses endorsed our efforts to market the CHAD. They liked having the responsibility as a community partner to facilitate the neighborhood’s brand. Some community partners even opted to put the poster advertisement in their window.\r\n\r\nThe committee accepted our proposed marketing plan and the posters, stickers, and postcards were successfully promoted in the Capitol Hill Arts District throughout the summer of 2017.\r\n<h3>Sources</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><a href="http://capitolhillarts.org/now-entering/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Capitol Hill Arts, Now Entering campaign page</a></li>\r\n 	<li><a href="https://segd.org/what-wayfinding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">What is Wayfinding? — Seattle Environmental Graphic Design</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[column_wrap count="2"]\r\n\r\n[column]\r\n<img class="alignnone wp-image-223 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_postcards-front-01.jpg" alt="" />\r\n[/column]\r\n\r\n[column]\r\n\r\n<img class="alignnone wp-image-222 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_postcards-back.jpg" alt="" width="2812" height="2824" />\r\n\r\n[/column]\r\n\r\n[/column_wrap]\r\n\r\n[column_wrap count="9"]\r\n[column]\r\n<img class="alignnone wp-image-234 size-thumbnail" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-dark-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />\r\n[/column][column]\r\n<img class="alignnone wp-image-227 size-thumbnail" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-1-red-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="135" height="135" />\r\n[/column][column]\r\n<img class="alignnone wp-image-228 size-thumbnail" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-2-orange-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="135" height="135" />\r\n[/column][column]\r\n<img class="alignnone wp-image-229 size-thumbnail" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-3-yellow-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="135" height="135" />\r\n[/column][column]\r\n<img class="alignnone wp-image-230 size-thumbnail" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-4-green-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="135" height="135" />\r\n[/column][column]\r\n<img class="alignnone wp-image-231 size-thumbnail" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-5-teal-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />\r\n[/column][column]\r\n<img class="alignnone wp-image-232 size-thumbnail" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-6-blue-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="135" height="135" />\r\n[/column][column]\r\n<img class="alignnone wp-image-233 size-thumbnail" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-7-purple-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="135" height="135" />\r\n[/column][column]\r\n<img class="alignnone wp-image-235 size-thumbnail" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CHAD_stickers_4in-light-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="135" height="135" />\r\n[/column]\r\n[/column_wrap]', 'Capitol Hill Arts District', 'As Design Team Lead, some colleagues and I partnered with the Capitol Hill Arts District to design an awareness campaign that coincided with their new website.', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '217-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-07-11 02:58:40', '2018-07-11 02:58:40', '', 217, 'http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/217-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

It primarily informs residents of the services available to them. We proposed to mount these posters on community boards in public building spaces, around the building property and within CHH offices. This poster design acts as the outward, public facing representation of the CHH Resident Services.\r\n[/image_block]\r\n<h3>Background</h3>\r\nCapitol Hill Housing Resident Service department employs Resident Service Coordinators (RSC) to inform, coordinate and provide resources to its diverse residents. The RSC primarily communicate with residents through information sheets, advertisements on community boards, door-to-door tactics, community, and building events and direct one-on-one contact. They serve as the central resource for all residents living in CHH properties, providing a range of services including general questions, hosting community events and coordinating need-based services such as rental assistance, live-in health care and transportation services to name a few.\r\n<h3>Project Challenges &amp; Goals</h3>\r\nAccording to CHH resident surveys, less than half the residents were aware that CHH provided individualized support through its Resident Services Program. Additionally, the RSC relied heavily on Microsoft word, so it became important to create a template system any RSC could use on any type of computer. As such, the project goals were identified as follows:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Inform residents about RSC and increase awareness of the many services available</li>\r\n 	<li>Simplify the layout and be consistent with the CHH brand</li>\r\n 	<li>Improve the collateral functionality and usability for RSC</li>\r\n 	<li>Improve and increase the visual accessibility for CHH’s diverse residents</li>\r\n 	<li>Improve and increase the trust between resident and RSC in individual communities</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Design Strategy</h3>\r\nTo achieve these goals, I brainstormed the visual design by assessing technical concerns, researching the methods in which RSC communicate with residents, and reviewed the overall brand image and messaging of CHH. To increase overall brand awareness, I set forth to develop a template system that is unique for individual properties, yet consistent with the larger CHH brand. Additionally, my deliverables were simply formatted and easily customizable for the RSC.\r\n<h3>Design Solutions</h3>\r\nThe client hired me to provide graphic design services for five collateral items most utilized by the RSC. The existing collateral was redesigned to met the aforementioned goals into five unified, brand consistent templates:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Building Welcome Sheets</li>\r\n 	<li>RSC Persona Sheets</li>\r\n 	<li>Monthly Events Calendar</li>\r\n 	<li>Event Flyers</li>\r\n 	<li>Resource One Sheets</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n[image_block][scroller]<img class="alignnone wp-image-51 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_welcome-sheetgeneral_8.5x11.jpg" alt="" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-52 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_welcome-sheetJoeyG_8.5x11.jpg" alt="" width="612" height="792" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-34 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tmpl_individual-rsc.jpg" alt="" width="2448" height="3264" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-32 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/poster_resident-services-e1530318746544.jpg" alt="" width="2366" height="2904" />[/scroller]\r\n<h4>Building Welcome and RSC Persona Sheets</h4>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon move in, residents receive a packet which includes the building welcome and RSC persona sheets. The building welcome sheet informs residents about CHH and resources available through the Resident Services program. The RSC persona sheet introduces the specific RS Coordinator supporting the residents’ property. Both these documents are intended to welcome residents and provide them essential resources, contact information, and other important details about CHH and RSC.</span>\r\n[/image_block]\r\n\r\n[image_block][scroller]<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-53" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE-calendar_11x8.5.jpg" alt="" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-35 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tmpl_residence-calendar-e1530319018147.jpg" alt="" width="2986" height="2341" />[/scroller]\r\n<h4>Monthly Events Calendar</h4>\r\nMonthly calendars specific to each property highlight upcoming community events. They are available online, by email and posted in community spaces. After creating a 2018-19 monthly calendar template with updated styles, I added additional content to the footer, for each RSC and building property. This allows the RSC to put their contact information and specific building information on the calendars for residents to easily reference.\r\n[/image_block]\r\n\r\n[image_block][scroller]<img class="alignnone wp-image-48 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_event-poster_8.5x11.jpg" alt="" width="612" height="792" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-47 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/BLANK_event-flyer_x2_5.5x8.5.jpg" alt="" width="2200" height="1700" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-33 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tmpl_event-flyers-e1530319332673.jpg" alt="" width="2325" height="2986" />[/scroller]\r\n<h4>Event Flyers</h4>\r\nEvent flyers posted in community spaces advertise a variety of events and workshops. For maximum ease of use and flexibility, I designed a variable sidebar layout for things like recurrent dates and event sign-ups. RSCs can choose between having a single event date or multiple recurring events, both, or neither.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, there is an option for a sign-up content block with a variable height, allowing for maximum customization. I also created a half-sheet event template that reduces event information to its hook, a primary message and call to action, for use by the RSC as handouts for local, building specific events.\r\n[/image_block]\r\n\r\n[image_block][scroller]<img class="alignnone wp-image-50 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_resource-one-sheet_8.5x11.jpg" alt="" width="1700" height="2200" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-36 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tmpl_resource-one-sheet-e1530319531779.jpg" alt="" width="2309" height="2888" />[/scroller]\r\n<h4>Resource One Sheets</h4>\r\nThese templates list all relevant contact information for each resource category. I created a typographic system and grid layout that adapts to each collateral template. The system I conceived maintains the appropriate balance between text legibility and readability. This one sheet example is the simplest form of typography and grid layout utilized across every template.\r\n[/image_block]\r\n<h3>Design Process</h3>\r\nThe challenges and client\'s goals were kept at the forefront of my process while designing the collateral. During each step of the project, the following were considered: consistency; accessibility; and usability.\r\n<h4>Consistency</h4>\r\nConsistency affects people’s awareness and trust of a brand. If residents aren’t clear what the RSC provide and who they are in relation to CHH, then they are likely to have less faith in the services provided. I directly addressed this issue through a systematically implemented visual design. Through use of typography, white space, graphic elements and color, I achieved overall visual consistency between all collateral templates.\r\n<h4>Accessibility</h4>\r\nThe visual design compliments the content strategy and does not detract from it. We simplified the text and used language understood by a general audience. I also utilized a relatively large font size to improve legibility and tested the color contrast, to ensure residents with visual impairments could view the content.\r\n<h4>Usability</h4>\r\nTo provide maximum ease of use for the RSC, who may not have a background in design or layout programs, I chose Adobe InDesign to make the templates. The Adobe InDesign has excellent interface with Adobe Acrobat, a program used by the majority of CHH employees. This resulted in great ease of use for the RSC, allowing for editable content while maintaining overall brand consistency.\r\n<h3>Project Results</h3>\r\nThe overall response from the Client, CHH employees, Resident Service Coordinators and residents was overwhelmingly positive. The visual design and functionality of my project deliverables exceeded their expectations. In fact, after using the new templates, several RSC requested more variations for the event flyers, resulting in additional project work.\r\n\r\nWhile redesigning the RSC collateral, I created a visual design inspired by the existing CHH brand. It maintained the familiarity of the old styles, while drastically improving RSC brand accessibility, usability, and consistency. Our focus on content strategy, language and visual harmony allowed the collateral to accommodate the diverse audiences with propriety and appeal.\r\n\r\n[scroller]\r\n<img class="alignnone wp-image-71 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/IMG_3094_small.jpg" alt="Capitol Hill Housing community event" width="500" height="333" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-90 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/IMG_2666.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="1600" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-89 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/IMG_2499.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="1200" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-70 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CAPHILLHOUSING-186-1.jpg" alt="Ashwin Warrior enters the Capitol Hill Housing offices on 12th Ave." width="3000" height="2000" />[/scroller]', 'Capitol Hill Housing Resident Services', 'The Capitol Hill Housing Resident Services department needed some brand collateral redesign, in response to many residents indicating they are unaware of Resident Services Coordinators and the resources they provide.', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '23-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-07-11 19:54:31', '2018-07-11 19:54:31', '', 23, 'http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/23-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

I excel at composing and formulating information into clear visuals that demonstrate mature application of design theory and practice. With a diverse background in digital and print design, I work with local businesses to develop impact driven collateral including marketing tools, brand identity, templates, website design, presentations and visual strategies.\r\n\r\nMy experience working with a startup, an architecture studio, designing for Seattle businesses, and serving on a 501(c)(3) board as the Design and Marketing Chair, allowed me the opportunity to gain in depth knowledge about the professional and creative sides of design.\r\n<h3>People tell me I am good at</h3>\r\n<h4>Asking Questions</h4>\r\nMy process is driven by curiosity. I address challenges creatively by asking questions first. Afterwards, I thoroughly research target markets, audience demographics, typography and design patterns. At the same time, hand sketching and photographic moodboards compliment my research. This part of my process inspires further conceptual development and helps me understand the variables involved — to properly execute a visual strategy that achieves the project goals.\r\n<h4>Iteration &amp; Variation</h4>\r\nI use an iterative design process to explore many design concepts. Team critiques are an important component to iteration. It opens up dialogue between the design concept and its stakeholders. Brainstorming is another tactic I utilize in my workflow to help teams visualize and orient towards a design concept. These conversations inform my process and serve further conceptual development.\r\n<h4>Organization</h4>\r\nWhether it’s my desk space, a quarterly marketing plan, or comprehensive designs, I maintain an organized workspace and accessible workflow. My design process adapts to new project variables easily.

He contracted fellow designer, Kenzie Nicholson, and I to execute the brand design. Kenzie and I collaboratively envisioned a brand identity; developed a handout menu, large format menu and food packaging for CMB’s grand opening.\r\n<h3>Project Challenges &amp; Goals</h3>\r\nCheese Meats Bread is an international take on an American classic—the grilled cheese sandwich. Mr. Chung planned to open in the Uwajimaya Village marketplace in the International District, Seattle\r\n<h3>Design Strategy</h3>\r\nDuring the research phase Kenzie and I talked largely about how to add an international flare to an American classic without having the brand be offensive or too intrusive for a largely international audience.\r\n<h3>Design Solution</h3>\r\nKenzie and I worked collaboratively throughout the project brainstorming, concept development, and refinement phases. When executing the final deliverables, Kenzie created the typographic pattern and packaging design, while I focused on the large format menu board, small take-out menu, and brand identity style guide.\r\n\r\n[image_block][scroller bg-color:"white"]<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-185" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CMB_style-guide_8.5x11.jpg" alt="" /><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-188" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CMB-menu_6x11.jpg" alt="" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-187 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CMB_menu-board_6x4ft_opt-2.jpg" alt="" />[/scroller]\r\n<h4>Brand style guide</h4>\r\n<h4>6x11 in. takeout menu</h4>\r\n<h4>6x4 ft. menu board</h4>\r\n[/image_block]\r\n<h3>Design Process</h3>\r\nWhile brainstorming and exploring concepts, Kenzie and I provided the client with numerous concepts, each of which approached the CMB brand from a unique lens. Upon listening more closely to general feedback from others and the client’s reaction to our presentation, they liked the variety of font selections we provided, but overall they gravitated towards more simpler fonts and cleaner illustrations. We decided on a typographic solution that used a simple logo mark and a typographic pattern as the primary brand elements, with a gooey yellow accent color—<em>Yumm!</em>\r\n<h3>Project Impact</h3>\r\nWe successfully delivered the brand identity packet to the client on schedule and within our budget. Afterwards, I maintained a positive relationship with the client and both design colleagues.

This part of my process inspires further conceptual development and helps me understand the variables involved — to properly execute a visual strategy that achieves the project goals.\r\n<h4>Iteration &amp; Variation</h4>\r\nI use an iterative design process to explore many design concepts. Team critiques are an important component to iteration. It opens up dialogue between the design concept and its stakeholders. Brainstorming is another tactic I utilize in my workflow to help teams visualize and orient towards a design concept. These conversations inform my process and serve further conceptual development.\r\n<h4>Organization</h4>\r\nWhether it’s my desk space, a quarterly marketing plan, or comprehensive designs, I maintain an organized workspace and accessible workflow.

The building is a multi-use apartment complex with entirely low-income eligible units and over 2,500 square feet of commercial space for local businesses. It is currently under construction and scheduled to open February 2019.\r\n<h3>Background</h3>\r\nThe Liberty Bank Building is the result of a collective partnership between Africa Town Central District, Byrd Barr Place, Black Community Impact Alliance, the Capitol Hill Housing Foundation, local community leaders and founders of the Liberty Bank. This historic project aspires to preserve the legacy of <em>the Liberty Bank</em>, "the first Black-owned bank west of the Mississippi, founded as a community response to redlining and disinvestment in Central Seattle" (libertybankbuilding.org).\r\n\r\nHistorically, the City government divested from the Central District. This segregated community became a hub for pan-African and migrant community culture. Today it is experiencing rapid urban development, and as rent increases faster than the existing community members are able to afford, they become displaced from their homes.\r\n\r\nThe Liberty Bank Building is designed to be affordable for everyday people, and continues to support the community for years to come. We wanted to highlight this legacy, preserve the existing identity of the Central District, and steward in a new generation of community engagement.\r\n<h3>Project Challenges &amp; Goals</h3>\r\nExisting Liberty Bank material, while resourceful, was lengthy and complex, making it impractical for the target audience. A key assignment for this project was to create leasing content that would be understandable and usable for <em>all members</em> of the community—<em>it needed to be accessible</em>.\r\n\r\nThe leasing packet design was heavily influenced by all these factors. The project goals were:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>to clarify the eligibility requirements for affordable housing</li>\r\n 	<li>walk applicants through the leasing process and timeline for the Liberty Bank Building</li>\r\n 	<li>affirmatively market to audiences affected by rapid urbanization in the Central District</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Design Strategy</h3>\r\nThe design needed to be tailored to a broad range of audience segments. The primary audience was individuals and families living in the Central District who qualify for affordable housing. The secondary audience was community members and small businesses, particularly of pan-African decent, affected by rapidly rising rent. The third audience, was public officials, agencies, and organization who work in the housing marketplace.\r\n\r\nTo clarify the eligibility requirements for affordable housing and walk applicants through the leasing process, I neatly organized complex leasing information in a format accessible to a broad audience whom are largely unfamiliar with affordable housing regulation in Seattle, but have a deeply rooted history in the Central District.\r\n<h3>Design Solution</h3>\r\n[scroller bg-color="LightSlateGrey"]\r\n<img class="alignnone wp-image-307 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018-05-04_LBB-leasing-packet-refinements_spread_1.jpg" alt="" width="1275" height="1650" /> <img class="alignnone wp-image-308 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018-05-04_LBB-leasing-packet-refinements_spread_2.jpg" alt="" width="2550" height="1650" /> <img class="alignnone wp-image-309 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018-05-04_LBB-leasing-packet-refinements_spread_3.jpg" alt="" width="2550" height="1650" /> <img class="alignnone wp-image-310 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018-05-04_LBB-leasing-packet-refinements_spread_4.jpg" alt="" width="2550" height="1650" /> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-311" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018-05-04_LBB-leasing-packet-refinements_spread_5.jpg" alt="" />\r\n[/scroller]\r\n\r\nThe Capitol Hill Housing Foundation hired me to deliver a single leasing packet of the following items:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>General building information including amenities, photos, and location map</li>\r\n 	<li>Affordable housing process overview</li>\r\n 	<li>Income requirements for applying</li>\r\n 	<li>A timeline of the project development and leasing process</li>\r\n 	<li>Frequently Asked Questions sheet</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Design Process</h3>\r\nLeasing affordable housing differs from non-subsidized apartments; and the Liberty Bank Building itself poses a unique application process. While focusing on conceptual development with moodboards, typography and color schemes, I worked with the team to categorize, synthesize and tailor content strategically.\r\n\r\nThe visual design is intuitive and simply explains affordable housing, the application process, and eligibility requirements use accessible language. Visual graphs and tables help applicants interactively determine their eligibility, while a four step visual breakdown walks them through the leasing process.\r\n\r\nWe sourced historic photos from the Liberty Bank partners, and composed them with photos of the new Liberty Bank Building. I coordinated with the client to render a more diverse group of people in the building renderings. I was sure to prioritize contact information; and developed a Frequently Asked Questions spread. I also included a timeline of key dates for the project construction and leasing process.\r\n<h3>Project Impact</h3>\r\nThe layout itself is a huge improvement from the single word document the partners began with. Including photos of the historic Central District and current community events, drastically improved the packet\'s relatability. The use of visual motifs, typographic hierarchy and layout, and brand consistency were driving forces behind achieving project goals.\r\n\r\nThe partners responded very positively to the leasing packet design. The project delivered on schedule and within budget. Once the Liberty Bank Building partners begin actively marketing, it is anticipated this leasing packet will allow local community members to become more familiar with the affordable housing application process and give them the confidence to inquire about living at the Liberty Bank Building.\r\n\r\nThe Liberty Bank Building partners utilized the leasing packet to affirmatively market to audiences affected by rapid urbanization. They plan to host local events to build community and pass out these leasing packets to residents in need. The visual design compliments their marketing tactics in a way that communicates the history of the Liberty Bank, expresses the future tone of the Liberty Bank Building, and respects the pan-African community in the Central District.\r\n<h3>Sources</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><a href="http://libertybankbuilding.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Liberty Bank Building</a></li>\r\n 	<li><a href="http://www.africatownlandtrust.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Africa Town Land Trust, Central District</a></li>\r\n 	<li><a href="https://byrdbarrplace.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Byrd Barr Place</a></li>\r\n 	<li><a href="http://david-harris-wkj7.squarespace.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black Community Impact Alliance</a></li>\r\n 	<li><a href="https://www.capitolhillhousing.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Capitol Hill Housing Foundation</a></li>\r\n</ul>', 'The Liberty Bank Building', 'For the Capitol Hill Housing leasing department, I conceptualized, designed and developed a leasing packet for an affordable housing development in the Central District called the Liberty Bank Building.', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '160-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-07-12 18:03:26', '2018-07-12 18:03:26', '', 160, 'http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/160-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Their mission is to build vibrant and engaged communities through affordable housing and community development. In total, CHH manages approximately 50 properties, each with eligibility requirements ranging from low-income, elderly, disabled, veteran and other eligibility restricted units.\r\n\r\n[image_block]\r\n<img class="alignnone wp-image-49 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_Resident-Services-poster_11x17.jpg" alt="" width="792" height="1224" />\r\n<h4>Resident Services Poster</h4>\r\nI designed a large format poster to advertise CHH Resident Services. It primarily informs residents of the services available to them. We proposed to mount these posters on community boards in public building spaces, around the building property and within CHH offices. This poster design acts as the outward, public facing representation of the CHH Resident Services.\r\n[/image_block]\r\n<h3>Background</h3>\r\nCapitol Hill Housing Resident Service department employs Resident Service Coordinators (RSC) to inform, coordinate and provide resources to its diverse residents. The RSC primarily communicate with residents through information sheets, advertisements on community boards, door-to-door tactics, community, and building events and direct one-on-one contact. They serve as the central resource for all residents living in CHH properties, providing a range of services including general questions, hosting community events and coordinating need-based services such as rental assistance, live-in health care and transportation services to name a few.\r\n<h3>Project Challenges &amp; Goals</h3>\r\nAccording to CHH resident surveys, less than half the residents were aware that CHH provided individualized support through its Resident Services Program. Additionally, the RSC relied heavily on Microsoft word, so it became important to create a template system any RSC could use on any type of computer. As such, the project goals were identified as follows:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Inform residents about RSC and increase awareness of the many services available</li>\r\n 	<li>Simplify the layout and be consistent with the CHH brand</li>\r\n 	<li>Improve the collateral functionality and usability for RSC</li>\r\n 	<li>Improve and increase the visual accessibility for CHH’s diverse residents</li>\r\n 	<li>Improve and increase the trust between resident and RSC in individual communities</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Design Strategy</h3>\r\nTo achieve these goals, I brainstormed the visual design by assessing technical concerns, researching the methods in which RSC communicate with residents, and reviewed the overall brand image and messaging of CHH. To increase overall brand awareness, I set forth to develop a template system that is unique for individual properties, yet consistent with the larger CHH brand. Additionally, my deliverables were simply formatted and easily customizable for the RSC.\r\n<h3>Design Solutions</h3>\r\nThe client hired me to provide graphic design services for five collateral items most utilized by the RSC. The existing collateral was redesigned to met the aforementioned goals into five unified, brand consistent templates:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Building Welcome Sheets</li>\r\n 	<li>RSC Persona Sheets</li>\r\n 	<li>Monthly Events Calendar</li>\r\n 	<li>Event Flyers</li>\r\n 	<li>Resource One Sheets</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n[image_block][scroller]<img class="alignnone wp-image-51 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_welcome-sheetgeneral_8.5x11.jpg" alt="" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-52 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_welcome-sheetJoeyG_8.5x11.jpg" alt="" width="612" height="792" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-34 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tmpl_individual-rsc.jpg" alt="" width="2448" height="3264" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-32 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/poster_resident-services-e1530318746544.jpg" alt="" width="2366" height="2904" />[/scroller]\r\n<h4>Building Welcome and RSC Persona Sheets</h4>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon move in, residents receive a packet which includes the building welcome and RSC persona sheets.

Both these documents are intended to welcome residents and provide them essential resources, contact information, and other important details about CHH and RSC.</span>\r\n[/image_block]\r\n\r\n[image_block][scroller]<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-53" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE-calendar_11x8.5.jpg" alt="" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-35 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tmpl_residence-calendar-e1530319018147.jpg" alt="" width="2986" height="2341" />[/scroller]\r\n<h4>Monthly Events Calendar</h4>\r\nMonthly calendars specific to each property highlight upcoming community events. They are available online, by email and posted in community spaces. After creating a 2018-19 monthly calendar template with updated styles, I added additional content to the footer, for each RSC and building property. This allows the RSC to put their contact information and specific building information on the calendars for residents to easily reference.\r\n[/image_block]\r\n\r\n[image_block][scroller]<img class="alignnone wp-image-48 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_event-poster_8.5x11.jpg" alt="" width="612" height="792" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-47 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/BLANK_event-flyer_x2_5.5x8.5.jpg" alt="" width="2200" height="1700" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-33 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tmpl_event-flyers-e1530319332673.jpg" alt="" width="2325" height="2986" />[/scroller]\r\n<h4>Event Flyers</h4>\r\nEvent flyers posted in community spaces advertise a variety of events and workshops. For maximum ease of use and flexibility, I designed a variable sidebar layout for things like recurrent dates and event sign-ups. RSCs can choose between having a single event date or multiple recurring events, both, or neither.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, there is an option for a sign-up content block with a variable height, allowing for maximum customization. I also created a half-sheet event template that reduces event information to its hook, a primary message and call to action, for use by the RSC as handouts for local, building specific events.\r\n[/image_block]\r\n\r\n[image_block][scroller]<img class="alignnone wp-image-50 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_resource-one-sheet_8.5x11.jpg" alt="" width="1700" height="2200" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-36 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tmpl_resource-one-sheet-e1530319531779.jpg" alt="" width="2309" height="2888" />[/scroller]\r\n<h4>Resource One Sheets</h4>\r\nThese templates list all relevant contact information for each resource category. I created a typographic system and grid layout that adapts to each collateral template. The system I conceived maintains the appropriate balance between text legibility and readability. This one sheet example is the simplest form of typography and grid layout utilized across every template.\r\n[/image_block]\r\n<h3>Design Process</h3>\r\nThe challenges and client\'s goals were kept at the forefront of my process while designing the collateral. During each step of the project, the following were considered: consistency; accessibility; and usability.\r\n<h4>Consistency</h4>\r\nConsistency affects people’s awareness and trust of a brand. If residents aren’t clear what the RSC provide and who they are in relation to CHH, then they are likely to have less faith in the services provided. I directly addressed this issue through a systematically implemented visual design. Through use of typography, white space, graphic elements and color, I achieved overall visual consistency between all collateral templates.\r\n<h4>Accessibility</h4>\r\nThe visual design compliments the content strategy and does not detract from it. We simplified the text and used language understood by a general audience. I also utilized a relatively large font size to improve legibility and tested the color contrast, to ensure residents with visual impairments could view the content.\r\n<h4>Usability</h4>\r\nTo provide maximum ease of use for the RSC, who may not have a background in design or layout programs, I chose Adobe InDesign to make the templates. The Adobe InDesign has excellent interface with Adobe Acrobat, a program used by the majority of CHH employees. This resulted in great ease of use for the RSC, allowing for editable content while maintaining overall brand consistency.\r\n<h3>Project Results</h3>\r\nThe overall response from the Client, CHH employees, Resident Service Coordinators and residents was overwhelmingly positive. The visual design and functionality of my project deliverables exceeded their expectations. In fact, after using the new templates, several RSC requested more variations for the event flyers, resulting in additional project work.\r\n\r\nWhile redesigning the RSC collateral, I created a visual design inspired by the existing CHH brand. It maintained the familiarity of the old styles, while drastically improving RSC brand accessibility, usability, and consistency. Our focus on content strategy, language and visual harmony allowed the collateral to accommodate the diverse audiences with propriety and appeal.\r\n\r\n[scroller]\r\n<img class="alignnone wp-image-71 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/IMG_3094_small.jpg" alt="Capitol Hill Housing community event" width="500" height="333" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-90 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/IMG_2666.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="1600" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-89 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/IMG_2499.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="1200" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-70 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CAPHILLHOUSING-186-1.jpg" alt="Ashwin Warrior enters the Capitol Hill Housing offices on 12th Ave." width="3000" height="2000" />[/scroller]', 'Capitol Hill Housing Resident Services', 'The Capitol Hill Housing Resident Services department needed brand collateral redesign, in response to many residents indicating they are unaware of Resident Services Coordinators and the resources they provide.', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '23-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-07-12 18:04:13', '2018-07-12 18:04:13', '', 23, 'http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/23-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),
(331, 1, '2018-07-12 18:10:48', '2018-07-12 18:10:48', 'Capitol Hill Housing (CHH) is a public corporation organized by the City of Seattle. Their mission is to build vibrant and engaged communities through affordable housing and community development. In total, CHH manages approximately 50 properties, each with eligibility requirements ranging from low-income, elderly, disabled, veteran and other eligibility restricted units.\r\n\r\n[image_block]\r\n<img class="alignnone wp-image-49 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_Resident-Services-poster_11x17.jpg" alt="" width="792" height="1224" />\r\n<h4>Resident Services Poster</h4>\r\nI designed a large format poster to advertise CHH Resident Services. It primarily informs residents of the services available to them. We proposed to mount these posters on community boards in public building spaces, around the building property and within CHH offices. This poster design acts as the outward, public facing representation of the CHH Resident Services.\r\n[/image_block]\r\n<h3>Background</h3>\r\nCapitol Hill Housing Resident Service department employs Resident Service Coordinators (RSC) to inform, coordinate and provide resources to its diverse residents. The RSC primarily communicate with residents through information sheets, advertisements on community boards, door-to-door tactics, and building events and direct one-on-one contact. They serve as the central resource for all residents living in CHH properties, providing a range of services including general questions, hosting community events and coordinating need-based services such as rental assistance, live-in health care and transportation services to name a few.\r\n<h3>Project Challenges &amp; Goals</h3>\r\nAccording to CHH resident surveys, less than half the residents were aware that CHH provided individualized support through its Resident Services Program. Additionally, the RSC relied heavily on Microsoft word, so it became important to create a template system any RSC could use on any type of computer. As such, the project goals were identified as follows:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Inform residents about RSC and increase awareness of the many services available</li>\r\n 	<li>Simplify the layout and be consistent with the CHH brand</li>\r\n 	<li>Improve the collateral functionality and usability for RSC</li>\r\n 	<li>Improve and increase the visual accessibility for CHH’s diverse residents</li>\r\n 	<li>Improve and increase the trust between resident and RSC in individual communities</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Design Strategy</h3>\r\nTo achieve these goals, I brainstormed the visual design by assessing technical concerns, researching the methods in which RSC communicate with residents, and reviewing the overall brand image and messaging of CHH. To increase overall brand awareness, I set forth to develop a template system that is unique for individual properties, yet consistent with the larger CHH brand. Additionally, my deliverables were simply formatted and easily customizable for the RSC.\r\n<h3>Design Solutions</h3>\r\nThe client hired me to provide graphic design services for five collateral items most utilized by the RSC. The existing collateral was redesigned to meet the aforementioned goals into five unified, brand consistent templates:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Building Welcome Sheets</li>\r\n 	<li>RSC Persona Sheets</li>\r\n 	<li>Monthly Events Calendar</li>\r\n 	<li>Event Flyers</li>\r\n 	<li>Resource One Sheets</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n[image_block][scroller]<img class="alignnone wp-image-51 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_welcome-sheetgeneral_8.5x11.jpg" alt="" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-52 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_welcome-sheetJoeyG_8.5x11.jpg" alt="" width="612" height="792" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-34 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tmpl_individual-rsc.jpg" alt="" width="2448" height="3264" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-32 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/poster_resident-services-e1530318746544.jpg" alt="" width="2366" height="2904" />[/scroller]\r\n<h4>Building Welcome and RSC Persona Sheets</h4>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon move in, residents receive a packet which includes the building welcome and RSC persona sheets. The building welcome sheet informs residents about CHH and resources available through the Resident Services program. The RSC persona sheet introduces the specific RS Coordinator supporting the residents’ property. Both these documents are intended to welcome residents and provide them essential resources, contact information, and other important details about CHH and RSC.</span>\r\n[/image_block]\r\n\r\n[image_block][scroller]<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-53" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE-calendar_11x8.5.jpg" alt="" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-35 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tmpl_residence-calendar-e1530319018147.jpg" alt="" width="2986" height="2341" />[/scroller]\r\n<h4>Monthly Events Calendar</h4>\r\nMonthly calendars specific to each property highlight upcoming community events. They are available online, by email and posted in community spaces. After creating a 2018-19 monthly calendar template with updated styles, I added additional content to the footer, for each RSC and building property. This allows the RSC to put their contact information and specific building information on the calendars for residents to easily reference.\r\n[/image_block]\r\n\r\n[image_block][scroller]<img class="alignnone wp-image-48 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_event-poster_8.5x11.jpg" alt="" width="612" height="792" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-47 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/BLANK_event-flyer_x2_5.5x8.5.jpg" alt="" width="2200" height="1700" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-33 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tmpl_event-flyers-e1530319332673.jpg" alt="" width="2325" height="2986" />[/scroller]\r\n<h4>Event Flyers</h4>\r\nEvent flyers posted in community spaces advertise a variety of events and workshops. For maximum ease of use and flexibility, I designed a variable sidebar layout for things like recurrent dates and event sign-ups. RSCs can choose between having a single event date or multiple recurring events, both, or neither.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, there is an option for a sign-up content block with a variable height, allowing for maximum customization. I also created a half-sheet event template that reduces event information to its hook, a primary message and call to action, for use by the RSC as handouts for local, building specific events.\r\n[/image_block]\r\n\r\n[image_block][scroller]<img class="alignnone wp-image-50 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/SAMPLE_resource-one-sheet_8.5x11.jpg" alt="" width="1700" height="2200" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-36 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tmpl_resource-one-sheet-e1530319531779.jpg" alt="" width="2309" height="2888" />[/scroller]\r\n<h4>Resource One Sheets</h4>\r\nThese templates list all relevant contact information for each resource category. I created a typographic system and grid layout that adapts to each collateral template. The system I conceived maintains the appropriate balance between text legibility and readability. This one sheet example is the simplest form of typography and grid layout utilized across every template.\r\n[/image_block]\r\n<h3>Design Process</h3>\r\nThe challenges and client\'s goals were kept at the forefront of my process while designing the collateral. During each step of the project, the following were considered: consistency; accessibility; and usability.\r\n<h4>Consistency</h4>\r\nConsistency affects people’s awareness and trust of a brand. If residents aren’t clear what the RSC provide and who they are in relation to CHH, then they are likely to have less faith in the services provided. I directly addressed this issue through a systematically implemented visual design. Through use of typography, white space, graphic elements and color, I achieved overall visual consistency between all collateral templates.\r\n<h4>Accessibility</h4>\r\nThe visual design complements the content strategy and does not detract from it. We simplified the text and used language understood by a general audience. I also utilized a relatively large font size to improve legibility and tested the color contrast, to ensure residents with visual impairments could view the content.\r\n<h4>Usability</h4>\r\nTo provide maximum ease of use for the RSC, who may not have a background in design or layout programs, I chose Adobe InDesign to make the templates. The Adobe InDesign has excellent interface with Adobe Acrobat, a program used by the majority of CHH employees. This resulted in great ease of use for the RSC, allowing for editable content while maintaining overall brand consistency.\r\n<h3>Project Results</h3>\r\nThe overall response from the Client, CHH employees, Resident Service Coordinators and residents was overwhelmingly positive. The visual design and functionality of my project deliverables exceeded their expectations. In fact, after using the new templates, several RSC requested more variations for the event flyers, resulting in additional project work.\r\n\r\nWhile redesigning the RSC collateral, I created a visual design inspired by the existing CHH brand. It maintained the familiarity of the old styles, while drastically improving RSC brand accessibility, usability, and consistency. Our focus on content strategy, language and visual harmony allowed the collateral to accommodate the diverse audiences with propriety and appeal.\r\n\r\n[scroller]\r\n<img class="alignnone wp-image-71 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/IMG_3094_small.jpg" alt="Capitol Hill Housing community event" width="500" height="333" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-90 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/IMG_2666.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="1600" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-89 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/IMG_2499.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="1200" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-70 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/CAPHILLHOUSING-186-1.jpg" alt="Ashwin Warrior enters the Capitol Hill Housing offices on 12th Ave." width="3000" height="2000" />[/scroller]', 'Capitol Hill Housing Resident Services', 'The Capitol Hill Housing Resident Services department needed brand collateral redesign, in response to many residents indicating they are unaware of Resident Services Coordinators and the resources they provide.', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '23-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-07-12 18:10:48', '2018-07-12 18:10:48', '', 23, 'http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/23-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

The building is a multi-use apartment complex with entirely low-income eligible units and over 2,500 square feet of commercial space for local businesses. It is currently under construction and scheduled to open February 2019.\n<h3>Background</h3>The Liberty Bank Building is the result of a collective partnership between Africa Town Central District, Byrd Barr Place, Black Community Impact Alliance, the Capitol Hill Housing Foundation, local community leaders and founders of the Liberty Bank. This historic project aspires to preserve the legacy of <em>the Liberty Bank</em>, "the first Black-owned bank west of the Mississippi, founded as a community response to redlining and disinvestment in Central Seattle" (libertybankbuilding.org).\n\nHistorically, the City government divested from the Central District. This segregated community became a hub for pan-African and migrant community culture. Today it is experiencing rapid urban development, and as rent increases faster than the existing community members are able to afford, they become displaced from their homes.\n\nThe Liberty Bank Building is designed to be affordable for everyday people, and continues to support the community for years to come. We wanted to highlight this legacy, preserve the existing identity of the Central District, and steward in a new generation of community engagement.\n<h3>Project Challenges &amp; Goals</h3>Existing Liberty Bank material, while resourceful, was lengthy and complex, making it impractical for the target audience. A key assignment for this project was to create leasing content that would be understandable and usable for <em>all members</em> of the community—<em>it needed to be accessible</em>.\n\nThe leasing packet design was heavily influenced by all these factors. The project goals were:\n<ul>\n 	<li>to clarify the eligibility requirements for affordable housing</li>\n 	<li>walk applicants through the leasing process and timeline for the Liberty Bank Building</li>\n 	<li>affirmatively market to audiences affected by rapid urbanization in the Central District</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Design Strategy</h3>The design needed to be tailored to a broad range of audience segments. The primary audience was individuals and families living in the Central District who qualify for affordable housing. The secondary audience was community members and small businesses, particularly of pan-African decent, affected by rapidly rising rent. The third audience, was public officials, agencies, and organization who work in the housing marketplace.\n\nTo clarify the eligibility requirements for affordable housing and walk applicants through the leasing process, I neatly organized complex leasing information in a format accessible to a broad audience whom are largely unfamiliar with affordable housing regulation in Seattle, but have a deeply rooted history in the Central District.\n<h3>Design Solution</h3>[scroller bg-color="LightSlateGrey"]\n<img src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018-05-04_LBB-leasing-packet-refinements_spread_1.jpg" class="alignnone wp-image-307 size-full" height="1650" alt="" width="1275"><img src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018-05-04_LBB-leasing-packet-refinements_spread_2.jpg" class="alignnone wp-image-308 size-full" height="1650" alt="" width="2550"><img src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018-05-04_LBB-leasing-packet-refinements_spread_3.jpg" class="alignnone wp-image-309 size-full" height="1650" alt="" width="2550"><img src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018-05-04_LBB-leasing-packet-refinements_spread_4.jpg" class="alignnone wp-image-310 size-full" height="1650" alt="" width="2550"><img src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018-05-04_LBB-leasing-packet-refinements_spread_5.jpg" class="alignnone wp-image-311 size-full" alt="">\n[/scroller]\n\nThe Capitol Hill Housing Foundation hired me to deliver a single leasing packet of the following items:\n<ul>\n 	<li>General building information including amenities, photos, and location map</li>\n 	<li>Affordable housing process overview</li>\n 	<li>Income requirements for applying</li>\n 	<li>A timeline of the project development and leasing process</li>\n 	<li>Frequently Asked Questions sheet</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Design Process</h3>Leasing affordable housing differs from non-subsidized apartments; and the Liberty Bank Building itself poses a unique application process. While focusing on conceptual development with moodboards, typography and color schemes, I worked with the team to categorize, synthesize and tailor content strategically.\n\nThe visual design is intuitive and simply explains affordable housing, the application process, and eligibility requirements use accessible language. Visual graphs and tables help applicants interactively determine their eligibility, while a four step visual breakdown walks them through the leasing process.\n\nWe sourced historic photos from the Liberty Bank partners, and composed them with photos of the new Liberty Bank Building. I coordinated with the client to render a more diverse group of people in the building renderings. I was sure to prioritize contact information; and developed a Frequently Asked Questions spread. I also included a timeline of key dates for the project construction and leasing process.\n<h3>Project Impact</h3>The layout itself is a huge improvement from the single word document the partners began with. Including photos of the historic Central District and current community events, drastically improved the packet\'s relatability. The use of visual motifs, typographic hierarchy and layout, and brand consistency were driving forces behind achieving project goals.\n\nThe partners responded very positively to the leasing packet design. The project delivered on schedule and within budget. Once the Liberty Bank Building partners begin actively marketing, it is anticipated this leasing packet will allow local community members to become more familiar with the affordable housing application process and give them the confidence to inquire about living at the Liberty Bank Building.\n\nThe Liberty Bank Building partners utilized the leasing packet to affirmatively market to audiences affected by rapid urbanization. They plan to host local events to build community and pass out these leasing packets to residents in need. The visual design compliments their marketing tactics in a way that communicates the history of the Liberty Bank, expresses the future tone of the Liberty Bank Building, and respects the pan-African community in the Central District.\n<h3>Sources</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li><a href="http://libertybankbuilding.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Liberty Bank Building</a></li>\n 	<li><a href="http://www.africatownlandtrust.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Africa Town Land Trust, Central District</a></li>\n 	<li><a href="https://byrdbarrplace.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Byrd Barr Place</a></li>\n 	<li><a href="http://david-harris-wkj7.squarespace.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black Community Impact Alliance</a></li>\n 	<li><a href="https://www.capitolhillhousing.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Capitol Hill Housing Foundation</a></li>\n</ul>', 'The Liberty Bank Building', 'For the Capitol Hill Housing leasing department, I conceptualized, designed and developed a leasing packet for an affordable housing development in the Central District called the Liberty Bank Building.', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '160-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-07-24 07:29:48', '2018-07-24 07:29:48', '', 160, 'http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/160-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

The building is a multi-use apartment complex with entirely low-income eligible units and over 2,500 square feet of commercial space for local businesses. It is currently under construction and scheduled to open February 2019.\r\n<h3>Background</h3>\r\nThe Liberty Bank Building is the result of a collective partnership between Africa Town Central District, Byrd Barr Place, Black Community Impact Alliance, the Capitol Hill Housing Foundation, local community leaders and founders of the Liberty Bank. This historic project aspires to preserve the legacy of <em>the Liberty Bank</em>, "the first Black-owned bank west of the Mississippi, founded as a community response to redlining and disinvestment in Central Seattle" (libertybankbuilding.org).\r\n\r\nHistorically, the City government divested from the Central District. This segregated community became a hub for pan-African and migrant community culture. Today it is experiencing rapid urban development, and as rent increases faster than the existing community members are able to afford, they become displaced from their homes.\r\n\r\nThe Liberty Bank Building is designed to be affordable for everyday people, and continues to support the community for years to come. We wanted to highlight this legacy, preserve the existing identity of the Central District, and steward in a new generation of community engagement.\r\n<h3>Project Challenges &amp; Goals</h3>\r\nExisting Liberty Bank material, while resourceful, was lengthy and complex, making it impractical for the target audience. A key assignment for this project was to create leasing content that would be understandable and usable for <em>all members</em> of the community—<em>it needed to be accessible</em>.\r\n\r\nThe leasing packet design was heavily influenced by all these factors. The project goals were:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>to clarify the eligibility requirements for affordable housing</li>\r\n 	<li>walk applicants through the leasing process and timeline for the Liberty Bank Building</li>\r\n 	<li>affirmatively market to audiences affected by rapid urbanization in the Central District</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Design Strategy</h3>\r\nThe design needed to be tailored to a broad range of audience segments. The primary audience was individuals and families living in the Central District who qualify for affordable housing. The secondary audience was community members and small businesses, particularly of pan-African decent, affected by rapidly rising rent. The third audience, was public officials, agencies, and organization who work in the housing marketplace.\r\n\r\nTo clarify the eligibility requirements for affordable housing and walk applicants through the leasing process, I neatly organized complex leasing information in a format accessible to a broad audience whom are largely unfamiliar with affordable housing regulation in Seattle, but have a deeply rooted history in the Central District.\r\n<h3>Design Solution</h3>\r\n[scroller bg-color="LightSlateGrey"]\r\n<img class="alignnone wp-image-307 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018-05-04_LBB-leasing-packet-refinements_spread_1.jpg" alt="" width="1275" height="1650" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-308 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018-05-04_LBB-leasing-packet-refinements_spread_2.jpg" alt="" width="2550" height="1650" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-309 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018-05-04_LBB-leasing-packet-refinements_spread_3.jpg" alt="" width="2550" height="1650" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-310 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018-05-04_LBB-leasing-packet-refinements_spread_4.jpg" alt="" width="2550" height="1650" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-311 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018-05-04_LBB-leasing-packet-refinements_spread_5.jpg" alt="" />\r\n[/scroller]\r\n\r\n[fullscreen view="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018-05-04_LBB-leasing-packet-refinements_spread_1.jpg"][/fullscreen]\r\n[fullscreen view="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018-05-04_LBB-leasing-packet-refinements_spread_2.jpg"][/fullscreen]\r\n[fullscreen view="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018-05-04_LBB-leasing-packet-refinements_spread_3.jpg"][/fullscreen]\r\n[fullscreen view="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018-05-04_LBB-leasing-packet-refinements_spread_4.jpg"][/fullscreen]\r\n\r\nThe Capitol Hill Housing Foundation hired me to deliver a single leasing packet of the following items:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>General building information including amenities, photos, and location map</li>\r\n 	<li>Affordable housing process overview</li>\r\n 	<li>Income requirements for applying</li>\r\n 	<li>A timeline of the project development and leasing process</li>\r\n 	<li>Frequently Asked Questions sheet</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Design Process</h3>\r\nLeasing affordable housing differs from non-subsidized apartments; and the Liberty Bank Building itself poses a unique application process.

The primary audience was individuals and families living in the Central District who qualify for affordable housing. The secondary audience was community members and small businesses, particularly of pan-African decent, affected by rapidly rising rent. The third audience, was public officials, agencies, and organization who work in the housing marketplace.\r\n\r\nTo clarify the eligibility requirements for affordable housing and walk applicants through the leasing process, I neatly organized complex leasing information in a format accessible to a broad audience whom are largely unfamiliar with affordable housing regulation in Seattle, but have a deeply rooted history in the Central District.\r\n<h3>Design Solution</h3>\r\n[scroller bg-color="LightSlateGrey"]\r\n<img class="alignnone wp-image-307 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018-05-04_LBB-leasing-packet-refinements_spread_1.jpg" alt="" width="1275" height="1650" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-308 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018-05-04_LBB-leasing-packet-refinements_spread_2.jpg" alt="" width="2550" height="1650" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-309 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018-05-04_LBB-leasing-packet-refinements_spread_3.jpg" alt="" width="2550" height="1650" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-310 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018-05-04_LBB-leasing-packet-refinements_spread_4.jpg" alt="" width="2550" height="1650" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-311 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018-05-04_LBB-leasing-packet-refinements_spread_5.jpg" alt="" />\r\n[/scroller]\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n[column_wrap count="4"]\r\n[column span="1"][fullscreen view="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018-05-04_LBB-leasing-packet-refinements_spread_1.jpg"]Page 1[/fullscreen][/column]\r\n[column span="1"][fullscreen view="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018-05-04_LBB-leasing-packet-refinements_spread_2.jpg"]Page 2[/fullscreen][/column]\r\n[column span="1"][fullscreen view="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018-05-04_LBB-leasing-packet-refinements_spread_3.jpg"]Page 3[/fullscreen][/column]\r\n[column span="1"][fullscreen view="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018-05-04_LBB-leasing-packet-refinements_spread_4.jpg"]Page 4[/fullscreen][/column]\r\n[/column_wrap]\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe Capitol Hill Housing Foundation hired me to deliver a single leasing packet of the following items:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>General building information including amenities, photos, and location map</li>\r\n 	<li>Affordable housing process overview</li>\r\n 	<li>Income requirements for applying</li>\r\n 	<li>A timeline of the project development and leasing process</li>\r\n 	<li>Frequently Asked Questions sheet</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Design Process</h3>\r\nLeasing affordable housing differs from non-subsidized apartments; and the Liberty Bank Building itself poses a unique application process.

The project scope included developing a logo design, brand style-guide, handout menu, large format menu, and food packaging for CMB\'s grand opening.\r\n<h3>Project Challenges &amp; Goals</h3>\r\nCheese Meats Bread is an international take on an American classic—the grilled cheese sandwich. Mr. Chung planned to open in the Uwajimaya Village marketplace in the International District, Seattle\r\n<h3>Design Strategy</h3>\r\nDuring the research phase we talked largely about how to add an international flare to an American classic without having the brand be offensive or too intrusive for a largely international audience.\r\n<h3>Design Solution</h3>\r\nOur team worked collaboratively throughout the project brainstorming, concept development, and refinement phases.

Upon listening more closely to general feedback from others and the client’s reaction to our presentation, they liked the variety of font selections we provided, but overall they gravitated towards more simpler fonts and cleaner illustrations.

The building is a multi-use apartment complex with entirely low-income eligible units and over 2,500 square feet of commercial space for local businesses. It is currently under construction and scheduled to open February 2019.\n<h3>Background</h3>The Liberty Bank Building is the result of a collective partnership between Africa Town Central District, Byrd Barr Place, Black Community Impact Alliance, the Capitol Hill Housing Foundation, local community leaders and founders of the Liberty Bank. This historic project aspires to preserve the legacy of <em>the Liberty Bank</em>, "the first Black-owned bank west of the Mississippi, founded as a community response to redlining and disinvestment in Central Seattle" (libertybankbuilding.org).\n\nHistorically, the City government divested from the Central District. This segregated community became a hub for pan-African and migrant community culture. Today it is experiencing rapid urban development, and as rent increases faster than the existing community members are able to afford, they become displaced from their homes.\n\nThe Liberty Bank Building is designed to be affordable for everyday people, and continues to support the community for years to come. We wanted to highlight this legacy, preserve the existing identity of the Central District, and steward in a new generation of community engagement.\n<h3>Project Challenges &amp; Goals</h3>Existing Liberty Bank material, while resourceful, was lengthy and complex, making it impractical for the target audience. A key assignment for this project was to create leasing content that would be understandable and usable for <em>all members</em> of the community—<em>it needed to be accessible</em>.\n\nThe leasing packet design was heavily influenced by all these factors. The project goals were:\n<ul>\n 	<li>to clarify the eligibility requirements for affordable housing</li>\n 	<li>walk applicants through the leasing process and timeline for the Liberty Bank Building</li>\n 	<li>affirmatively market to audiences affected by rapid urbanization in the Central District</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Design Strategy</h3>The design needed to be tailored to a broad range of audience segments. The primary audience was individuals and families living in the Central District who qualify for affordable housing. The secondary audience was community members and small businesses, particularly of pan-African decent, affected by rapidly rising rent. The third audience, was public officials, agencies, and organization who work in the housing marketplace.\n\nTo clarify the eligibility requirements for affordable housing and walk applicants through the leasing process, I neatly organized complex leasing information in a format accessible to a broad audience whom are largely unfamiliar with affordable housing regulation in Seattle, but have a deeply rooted history in the Central District.\n<h3>Design Solution</h3>[scroller bg-color="LightSlateGrey"]\n<img src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018-05-04_LBB-leasing-packet-refinements_spread_1.jpg" class="alignnone wp-image-307 size-full" height="1650" alt="" width="1275"><img src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018-05-04_LBB-leasing-packet-refinements_spread_2.jpg" class="alignnone wp-image-308 size-full" height="1650" alt="" width="2550"><img src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018-05-04_LBB-leasing-packet-refinements_spread_3.jpg" class="alignnone wp-image-309 size-full" height="1650" alt="" width="2550"><img src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018-05-04_LBB-leasing-packet-refinements_spread_4.jpg" class="alignnone wp-image-310 size-full" height="1650" alt="" width="2550"><img src="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018-05-04_LBB-leasing-packet-refinements_spread_5.jpg" class="alignnone wp-image-311 size-full" alt="">\n[/scroller]\n\n&lt;!--[column_wrap count="4"]\n[column span="1"][fullscreen view="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018-05-04_LBB-leasing-packet-refinements_spread_1.jpg"]Cover[/fullscreen][/column]\n[column span="1"][fullscreen view="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018-05-04_LBB-leasing-packet-refinements_spread_2.jpg"]About LBB[/fullscreen][/column]\n[column span="1"][fullscreen view="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018-05-04_LBB-leasing-packet-refinements_spread_3.jpg"]Leasing Process[/fullscreen][/column]\n[column span="1"][fullscreen view="http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/wp-content/uploads/2018-05-04_LBB-leasing-packet-refinements_spread_4.jpg"]FAQs[/fullscreen][/column]\n[/column_wrap]--&gt;\n\nThe Capitol Hill Housing Foundation hired me to deliver a single leasing packet of the following items:\n<ul>\n 	<li>General building information including amenities, photos, and location map</li>\n 	<li>Affordable housing process overview</li>\n 	<li>Income requirements for applying</li>\n 	<li>A timeline of the project development and leasing process</li>\n 	<li>Frequently Asked Questions sheet</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Design Process</h3>Leasing affordable housing differs from non-subsidized apartments; and the Liberty Bank Building itself poses a unique application process.

The use of visual motifs, typographic hierarchy and layout, and brand consistency were driving forces behind achieving project goals.\n\nThe partners responded very positively to the leasing packet design. The project delivered on schedule and within budget. Once the Liberty Bank Building partners begin actively marketing, it is anticipated this leasing packet will allow local community members to become more familiar with the affordable housing application process and give them the confidence to inquire about living at the Liberty Bank Building.\n\nThe Liberty Bank Building partners utilized the leasing packet to affirmatively market to audiences affected by rapid urbanization. They plan to host local events to build community and pass out these leasing packets to residents in need. The visual design compliments their marketing tactics in a way that communicates the history of the Liberty Bank, expresses the future tone of the Liberty Bank Building, and respects the pan-African community in the Central District.\n<h3>Sources</h3>\n<ul>\n 	<li><a href="http://libertybankbuilding.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Liberty Bank Building</a></li>\n 	<li><a href="http://www.africatownlandtrust.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Africa Town Land Trust, Central District</a></li>\n 	<li><a href="https://byrdbarrplace.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Byrd Barr Place</a></li>\n 	<li><a href="http://david-harris-wkj7.squarespace.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black Community Impact Alliance</a></li>\n 	<li><a href="https://www.capitolhillhousing.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Capitol Hill Housing Foundation</a></li>\n</ul>', 'The Liberty Bank Building', 'For the Capitol Hill Housing leasing department, I conceptualized, designed and developed a leasing packet for an affordable housing development in the Central District called the Liberty Bank Building.', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '160-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-07-25 19:38:06', '2018-07-25 19:38:06', '', 160, 'http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/160-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

The project delivered on schedule and within budget. Once the Liberty Bank Building partners begin actively marketing, it is anticipated this leasing packet will allow local community members to become more familiar with the affordable housing application process and give them the confidence to inquire about living at the Liberty Bank Building.\r\n\r\nThe Liberty Bank Building partners utilized the leasing packet to affirmatively market to audiences affected by rapid urbanization. They plan to host local events to build community and pass out these leasing packets to residents in need. The visual design compliments their marketing tactics in a way that communicates the history of the Liberty Bank, expresses the future tone of the Liberty Bank Building, and respects the pan-African community in the Central District.\r\n<h3>Sources</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><a href="http://libertybankbuilding.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Liberty Bank Building</a></li>\r\n 	<li><a href="http://www.africatownlandtrust.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Africa Town Land Trust, Central District</a></li>\r\n 	<li><a href="https://byrdbarrplace.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Byrd Barr Place</a></li>\r\n 	<li><a href="http://david-harris-wkj7.squarespace.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black Community Impact Alliance</a></li>\r\n 	<li><a href="https://www.capitolhillhousing.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Capitol Hill Housing Foundation</a></li>\r\n</ul>', 'The Liberty Bank Building', 'For the Capitol Hill Housing leasing department, I conceptualized, designed and developed a leasing packet for an affordable housing development in the Central District called the Liberty Bank Building.', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '160-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-07-25 19:40:15', '2018-07-25 19:40:15', '', 160, 'http://localhost:8888/JoeyGrable.com/2018_wp-grunt/160-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),
